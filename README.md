# machine_learning_project
These are some machine_learning_projects I made.

Most hot topics today on machine learning are all about mapping a range of input data to a range of targets, for these type of projects, I use the machine learning or deep learning title ,and the rest projects are categorized into Artificial Intelligence.

They are fall into three categories

1. machine learning 

projects using traditional models such as regression model/classification models

2. deep learning

projects using deeplearning frameworks such as CNN/RNN

3. artificial intelligence

Projects that do not relay on data. 

You can click on each file to view more detailed explaination about each project.
