# Machine Learning Project

These are some machine_learning_projects I made during learning machine learning concepts.

Most hot topics today on machine learning are all about mapping a range of input data to a range of targets, for these type of projects, I use the machine learning or deep learning title ,and the rest projects are categorized into Artificial Intelligence.

They are fall into three categories

1. machine learning 

projects implementing various machine learning models using sklearn library

> K-means

> K-nearest

> decision tree

> random forest

> SVM

> Regression

> Naive Bayes

During these projects, I've also used PCA, standardize scale ,filter out outliers, validation method, and evaluation method using precision/ recall and f1, f2 score. 

2. deep learning

projects using deeplearning frameworks

> bike prediction

> face generation

> image_classification

> language translation

> min_char_rnn

> sentiment_network

> simple_digit-recognition

> tv_script

Among these projects, various framework are used, including, CNN, RNN, Transfer Learning, reinforcement learning, LSTM, GAN 

3. artificial intelligence

> Planning System
> HMM
> Isolation
> Sudoku Solver

These projects do not relay on data.They are acting liked domain expert. Techniques used in these projects includes various search algorithm, alpha-beta prunning, probablistic graphic model.
