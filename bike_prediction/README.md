# bikesharing

In this project, I'm using one layer simple Neural Network to predict the bike sharing usage in bay area. 

The NN model is build using numpy

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

The main purpose of this project is to build gradient decent and backpropgation from scrach and get a good understanding of how to build a neural network.

main techniques used in this project

- convert catagorical data into continous data using binary encoding

- normalize data for model efficiency

- train,test,validation split
