### deep captchas

Adversarial examples
: These are constructed inputs
computed by adding a small and specific perturbation,
called adversarial noise, to correctly classified
items

### generation of captchas


The first generation of CAPTCHAs used deformations of
written text.

cons:susceptibility to segmentation attacks

The second generation of CAPTCHAs is image based captchas

cons: also susceptible to attacks

CORTCHA  
This system uses the contextual relationships
