## Recognize captchas with deep learning

Perviously, we normally use ORC to decode captchas or manually decode the information

presented in the system. Yet, as the area of Machine learning advances quickly, there is

definately places for it to be more involved in the the process.

In this project, I'm going to use deep learning to recognize captchas, as DL demonstrates

such strong power in classifying pictures. Here is the first project that I use the DL

to do the recognition task.

There are already lots of people doing research in this field.

for example this topic discuss the implementation of DL in captchas recognition project

(Reading irctc captchas with 98% accuracy using deep learning)[https://github.com/arunpatala/captcha.irctc]During the last few years,   

There are also existing papers discussing the use of GAN to enhance the Captcha security

the following paper introduces the  Immutable Adversarial Examples with Applications to CAPTCHA

[ Introducing Immutable Adversarial Examples with Applications to CAPTCHA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/336/20160330:075525)

As we can see, this field is advancing quickly. Let's start dive in

### Captcha Dataset description

The dataset I'm using here is the dataset created in the previous project


### Convolutional Neural Network description

we'll use a vgg net and adapt transfer learning in our model to achieve our goal

### Goal

get a accuracy better than the previous papper
