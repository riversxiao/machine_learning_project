                        Dark Spirit of the desart rudeThat o'er this awful solitude,Each tangled and untrodden wood,Each dark and silent glen below,Where sunlight's gleamings never glow,Whilst jetty, musical and still,In darkness speeds the mountain rill;That o'er yon broken peaks sublime,Wild shapes that mock the scythe of time,And the pure Ellan's foamy course,			Wavest thy wand of magic force;Art thou yon sooty and fearful fowlThat flaps its wing o'er the leafless oakThat o'er the dismal scene doth scowlAnd mocketh music with its croak?I've sought thee where day's beams decayOn the peak of the lonely hill,I've sought thee where they melt awayBy the wave of the pebbly rill;I've strained to catch thy murky form			Bestride the rapid and gloomy storm;Thy red and sullen eyeball's glareHas shot, in a dream, thro' the midnight airBut never did thy shape expressSuch an emphatic gloominess.And where art thou, O thing of gloom? ...On Nature's unreviving tombWhere sapless, blasted and aloneShe mourns her blooming centuries gone!- From the fresh sod the Violets peep,			The buds have burst their frozen sleep,Whilst every green and peopled treeIs alive with Earth's sweet melody.But thou alone art here,Thou desolate Oak, whose scathed headFor ages has never trembled,Whose giant trunk dead lichens bindMoaningly sighing in the wind,With huge loose rocks beneath thee spread,Thou, Thou alone art here!				Remote from every living thing,Tree, shrub or grass or flower,Thou seemest of this spot the KingAnd with a regal powerSuck like that race all sap awayAnd yet upon the spoil decay.                                                                                       To Mary — —                                          1.  So now my summer task is ended, Mary,       And I return to thee, mine own heart's home;   As to his Queen some victor Knight of Faëry,       Earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome;       Nor thou disdain, that ere my fame become   A star among the stars of mortal night,       If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom,   Its doubtful promise thus I would uniteWith thy beloved name, thou Child of love and light.                                         2.   The toil which stole from thee so many an hour       Is ended,—and the fruit is at thy feet!   No longer where the woods to frame a bower       With interlaced branches mix and meet,       Or where with sound like many voices sweet,   Water-falls leap among wild islands green,       Which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat   Of moss-grown trees and weeds, shall I be seen:But beside thee, where still my heart has ever been.                                         3.   Thoughts of great deeds were mine, dear Friend, when first       The clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass.   I do remember well the hour which burst       My spirit's sleep: a fresh May-dawn it was,       When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,   And wept, I knew not why; until there rose       From the near school-room, voices, that, alas!   Were but one echo from a world of woes—The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.                                         4.   And then I clasped my hands and looked around—       —But none was near to mock my streaming eyes,   Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground—       So without shame, I spake:—'I will be wise,       And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies   Such power, for I grow weary to behold       The selfish and the strong still tyrannise   Without reproach or check.' I then controuledMy tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.                                         5.   And from that hour did I with earnest thought       Heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore,   Yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught       I cared to learn, but from that secret store       Wrought linked armour for my soul, before   It might walk forth to war among mankind;       Thus power and hope were strengthened more and more   Within me, till there came upon my mindA sense of loneliness, a thirst with which I pined.                                         6.   Alas, that love should be a blight and snare       To those who seek all sympathies in one!—   Such once I sought in vain; then black despair,       The shadow of a starless night, was thrown       Over the world in which I moved alone:—   Yet never found I one not false to me,       Hard hearts, and cold, like weights of icy stone   Which crushed and withered mine, that could not beAught but a lifeless clog, until revived by thee.                                         7.   Thou Friend, whose presence on my wintry heart       Fell, like bright Spring upon some herbless plain;   How beautiful and calm and free thou wert       In thy young wisdom, when the mortal chain       Of Custom thou didst burst and rend in twain,   And walked as free as light the clouds among,       Which many an envious slave then breathed in vain   From his dim dungeon, and my spirit sprungTo meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long.                                         8.   No more alone through the world's wilderness,       Although I trod the paths of high intent,   I journeyed now: no more companionless,       Where solitude is like despair, I went.—       There is the wisdom of a stern content   When Poverty can blight the just and good,       When Infamy dares mock the innocent,   And cherished friends turn with the multitudeTo trample: this was ours, and we unshaken stood!                                         9.   Now has descended a serener hour,       And with inconstant fortune, friends return;   Though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power       Which says:—Let scorn be not repaid with scorn.       And from thy side two gentle babes are born   To fill our home with smiles, and thus are we      Most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn;   And these delights, and thou, have been to meThe parents of the Song I consecrate to thee.                                         10.   Is it, that now my inexperienced fingers       But strike the prelude of a loftier strain?   Or, must the lyre on which my spirit lingers       Soon pause in silence, ne'er to sound again,       Though it might shake the Anarch Custom's reign,   And charm the minds of men to Truth's own sway       Holier than was Amphion's? I would fain   Reply in hope—but I am worn away,And Death and Love are yet contending for their prey.                                         11.   And what art thou? I know, but dare not speak:       Time may interpret to his silent years.   Yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek,       And in the light thine ample forehead wears,       And in thy sweetest smiles, and in thy tears,  And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy       Is whispered, to subdue my fondest fears:   And through thine eyes, even in thy soul I seeA lamp of vestal fire burning internally.                                         12.   They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth,       Of glorious parents, thou aspiring Child.   I wonder not—for One then left this earth       Whose life was like a setting planet mild       Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled   Of its departing glory; still her fame       Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild   Which shake these latter days; and thou canst claimThe shelter, from thy Sire, of an immortal name.                                         13.   One voice came forth from many a mighty spirit,       Which was the echo of three thousand years;   And the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it,       As some lone man who in a desart hears       The music of his home:—unwonted fears   Fell on the pale oppressors of our race,       And Faith, and Custom, and low-thoughted cares,   Like thunder-stricken dragons, for a spaceLeft the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.                                         14.   Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!       If there must be no response to my cry—   If men must rise and stamp with fury blind       On his pure name who loves them,—thou and I,       Sweet Friend! can look from our tranquillity   Like lamps into the world's tempestuous night,—       Two tranquil stars, while clouds are passing by   Which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight,That burn from year to year with unextinguished light.                                                                     A scene, which 'wildered fancy viewedIn the soul's coldest solitude,With that same scene when peaceful loveFlings rapture's colour o'er the grove,When mountain, meadow, wood and stream With unalloying glory gleam,And to the spirit's ear and eyeAre unison and harmony.The moonlight was my dearer day;Then would I wander far away, And, lingering on the wild brook's shoreTo hear its unremitting roar,Would lose in the ideal flowAll sense of overwhelming woe;Or at the noiseless noon of nightWould climb some heathy mountain's height,And listen to the mystic soundThat stole in fitful gasps around.I joyed to see the streaks of dayAbove the purple peaks decay, And watch the latest line of lightJust mingling with the shades of night;For day with me was time of woeWhen even tears refused to flow;Then would I stretch my languid frame Beneath the wild woods' gloomiest shade,And try to quench the ceaseless flameThat on my withered vitals preyed;Would close mine eyes and dream I wereOn some remote and friendless plain, And long to leave existence there,If with it I might leave the painThat with a finger cold and leanWrote madness on my withering mien.It was not unrequited loveThat bade my ‘wildered spirit rove;'Twas not the pride disdaining life,That with this mortal world at strifeWould yield to the soul's inward sense,Then groan in human impotence,And weep because it is not givenTo taste on Earth the peace of Heaven.'Twas not that in the narrow sphereWhere Nature fixed my wayward fateThere was no friend or kindred dearFormed to become that spirit's mate,Which, searching on tired pinion, foundBarren and cold repulse around;Oh, no! yet each one sorrow gaveNew graces to the narrow grave. For broken vows had early quelledThe stainless spirit's vestal flame;Yes! whilst the faithful bosom swelled,Then the envenomed arrow came,And Apathy's unaltering eye Beamed coldness on the misery;And early I had learned to scornThe chains of clay that bound a soulPanting to seize the wings of morn,And where its vital fires were born To soar, and spur the cold controlWhich the vile slaves of earthly nightWould twine around its struggling flight.Oh, many were the friends whom fameHad linked with the unmeaning name, Whose magic marked among mankindThe casket of my unknown mind,Which hidden from the vulgar glareImbibed no fleeting radiance there.My darksome spirit sought--it found A friendless solitude around.For who that might undaunted stand,The saviour of a sinking land,Would crawl, its ruthless tyrant's slave,And fatten upon Freedom's grave, Though doomed with her to perish, whereThe captive clasps abhorred despair.They could not share the bosom's feeling,Which, passion's every throb revealing,Dared force on the world's notice coldThoughts of unprofitable mould,Who bask in Custom's fickle ray,Fit sunshine of such wintry day!They could not in a twilight walkWeave an impassioned web of talk,Till mysteries the spirits pressIn wild yet tender awfulness,Then feel within our narrow sphereHow little yet how great we are!But they might shine in courtly glare,Attract the rabble's cheapest stare,And might command where'er they moveA thing that bears the name of love;They might be learned, witty, gay,Foremost in fashion's gilt array,On Fame's emblazoned pages shine,Be princes' friends, but never mine!Ye jagged peaks that frown sublime,Mocking the blunted scythe of Time,Whence I would watch its lustre pale Steal from the moon o'er yonder valeThou rock, whose bosom black and vast,Bared to the stream's unceasing flow,Ever its giant shade doth castOn the tumultuous surge below: Woods, to whose depths retires to dieThe wounded Echo's melody,And whither this lone spirit bentThe footstep of a wild intent:Meadows! whose green and spangled breastThese fevered limbs have often pressed,Until the watchful fiend DespairSlept in the soothing coolness there!Have not your varied beauties seenThe sunken eye, the withering mien, Sad traces of the unuttered painThat froze my heart and burned my brain.How changed since Nature's summer formHad last the power my grief to charm,Since last ye soothed my spirit's sadness, Strange chaos of a mingled madness!Changed!--not the loathsome worm that fedIn the dark mansions of the dead,Now soaring through the fields of air,And gathering purest nectar there, A butterfly, whose million huesThe dazzled eye of wonder views,Long lingering on a work so strange,Has undergone so bright a change.How do I feel my happiness? I cannot tell, but they may guessWhose every gloomy feeling gone,Friendship and passion feel alone;Who see mortality's dull cloudsBefore affection's murmur fly, Whilst the mild glances of her eyePierce the thin veil of flesh that shroudsThe spirit's inmost sanctuary.O thou! whose virtues latest known,First in this heart yet claim'st a throne; Whose downy sceptre still shall shareThe gentle sway with virtue there;Thou fair in form, and pure in mind,Whose ardent friendship rivets fastThe flowery band our fates that bind, Which incorruptible shall lastWhen duty's hard and cold controlHas thawed around the burning soul,--The gloomiest retrospects that bindWith crowns of thorn the bleeding mind, The prospects of most doubtful hueThat rise on Fancy's shuddering view,--Are gilt by the reviving rayWhich thou hast flung upon my day.                                                                     I.Summer was dead and Autumn was expiring,And infant Winter laughed upon the landAll cloudlessly and cold;--when I, desiringMore in this world than any understand,Wept o’er the beauty, which, like sea retiring, Had left the earth bare as the wave-worn sandOf my lorn heart, and o’er the grass and flowersPale for the falsehood of the flattering Hours.II.Summer was dead, but I yet lived to weepThe instability of all but weeping; And on the Earth lulled in her winter sleepI woke, and envied her as she was sleeping.Too happy Earth! over thy face shall creepThe wakening vernal airs, until thou, leapingFrom unremembered dreams, shalt ... see No death divide thy immortality.III.I loved--oh, no, I mean not one of ye,Or any earthly one, though ye are dearAs human heart to human heart may be;--I loved, I know not what--but this low sphereAnd all that it contains, contains not thee,Thou, whom, seen nowhere, I feel everywhere.From Heaven and Earth, and all that in them are,Veiled art thou, like a ... star.IV.By Heaven and Earth, from all whose shapes thou flowest, Neither to be contained, delayed, nor hidden;Making divine the loftiest and the lowest,When for a moment thou art not forbiddenTo live within the life which thou bestowest;And leaving noblest things vacant and chidden, Cold as a corpse after the spirit’s flightBlank as the sun after the birth of night.V.In winds, and trees, and streams, and all things common,In music and the sweet unconscious toneOf animals, and voices which are human, Meant to express some feelings of their own;In the soft motions and rare smile of woman,In flowers and leaves, and in the grass fresh-shown,Or dying in the autumn, I the mostAdore thee present or lament thee lost. VI.And thus I went lamenting, when I sawA plant upon the river’s margin lieLike one who loved beyond his nature’s law,And in despair had cast him down to die;Its leaves, which had outlived the frost, the thaw Had blighted; like a heart which hatred’s eyeCan blast not, but which pity kills; the dewLay on its spotted leaves like tears too true.VII.The Heavens had wept upon it, but the EarthHad crushed it on her maternal breast...VIII.I bore it to my chamber, and I plantedIt in a vase full of the
