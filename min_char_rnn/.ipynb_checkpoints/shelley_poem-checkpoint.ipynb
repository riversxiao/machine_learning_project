    "# TV Script Generation\n",
    "In this project, you'll generate your own [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).\n",

      "The moonlight was my dearer day;Then would I wander far away, And, lingering on the wild brook's shoreTo hear its unremitting roar,Would lose in the ideal flowAll sense of overwhelming woe;Or at the noiseless noon of nightWould climb some heathy mountain's height,And listen to the mystic soundThat stole in fitful gasps around\n",
      "I joyed to see the streaks of dayAbove the purple peaks decay, And watch the latest line of lightJust mingling with the shades of night;For day with me was time of woeWhen even tears refused to flow;Then would I stretch my languid frame Beneath the wild woods' gloomiest shade,And try to quench the ceaseless flameThat on my withered vitals preyed;Would close mine eyes and dream I wereOn some remote and friendless plain, And long to leave existence there,If with it I might leave the painThat with a finger cold and leanWrote madness on my withering mien\n",
      "It was not unrequited loveThat bade my â€˜wildered spirit rove;'Twas not the pride disdaining life,That with this mortal world at strifeWould yield to the soul's inward sense,Then groan in human impotence,And weep because it is not givenTo taste on Earth the peace of Heaven\n",
      "'Twas not that in the narrow sphereWhere Nature fixed my wayward fateThere was no friend or kindred dearFormed to become that spirit's mate,Which, searching on tired pinion, foundBarren and cold repulse around;Oh, no! yet each one sorrow gaveNew graces to the narrow grave\n",
      " For broken vows had early quelledThe stainless spirit's vestal flame;Yes! whilst the faithful bosom swelled,Then the envenomed arrow came,And Apathy's unaltering eye Beamed coldness on the misery;And early I had learned to scornThe chains of clay that bound a soulPanting to seize the wings of morn,And where its vital fires were born To soar, and spur the cold controlWhich the vile slaves of earthly nightWould twine around its struggling flight\n",
      "Oh, many were the friends whom fameHad linked with the unmeaning name, Whose magic marked among mankindThe casket of my unknown mind,Which hidden from the vulgar glareImbibed no fleeting radiance there\n",

      "They could not share the bosom's feeling,Which, passion's every throb revealing,Dared force on the world's notice coldThoughts of unprofitable mould,Who bask in Custom's fickle ray,Fit sunshine of such wintry day!They could not in a twilight walkWeave an impassioned web of talk,Till mysteries the spirits pressIn wild yet tender awfulness,Then feel within our narrow sphereHow little yet how great we are!But they might shine in courtly glare,Attract the rabble's cheapest stare,And might command where'er they moveA thing that bears the name of love;They might be learned, witty, gay,Foremost in fashion's gilt array,On Fame's emblazoned pages shine,Be princes' friends, but never mine!Ye jagged peaks that frown sublime,Mocking the blunted scythe of Time,Whence I would watch its lustre pale Steal from the moon o'er yonder valeThou rock, whose bosom black and vast,Bared to the stream's unceasing flow,Ever its giant shade doth castOn the tumultuous surge below: Woods, to whose depths retires to dieThe wounded Echo's melody,And whither this lone spirit bentThe footstep of a wild intent:Meadows! whose green and spangled breastThese fevered limbs have often pressed,Until the watchful fiend DespairSlept in the soothing coolness there!Have not your varied beauties seenThe sunken eye, the withering mien, Sad traces of the unuttered painThat froze my heart and burned my brain\n"
