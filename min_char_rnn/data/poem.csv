"The Retrospect: Cwm Elan, 1812","                        A scene, which 'wildered fancy viewedIn the soul's coldest solitude,With that same scene when peaceful loveFlings rapture's colour o'er the grove,When mountain, meadow, wood and stream With unalloying glory gleam,And to the spirit's ear and eyeAre unison and harmony.The moonlight was my dearer day;Then would I wander far away, And, lingering on the wild brook's shoreTo hear its unremitting roar,Would lose in the ideal flowAll sense of overwhelming woe;Or at the noiseless noon of nightWould climb some heathy mountain's height,And listen to the mystic soundThat stole in fitful gasps around.I joyed to see the streaks of dayAbove the purple peaks decay, And watch the latest line of lightJust mingling with the shades of night;For day with me was time of woeWhen even tears refused to flow;Then would I stretch my languid frame Beneath the wild woods' gloomiest shade,And try to quench the ceaseless flameThat on my withered vitals preyed;Would close mine eyes and dream I wereOn some remote and friendless plain, And long to leave existence there,If with it I might leave the painThat with a finger cold and leanWrote madness on my withering mien.It was not unrequited loveThat bade my ‘wildered spirit rove;'Twas not the pride disdaining life,That with this mortal world at strifeWould yield to the soul's inward sense,Then groan in human impotence,And weep because it is not givenTo taste on Earth the peace of Heaven.'Twas not that in the narrow sphereWhere Nature fixed my wayward fateThere was no friend or kindred dearFormed to become that spirit's mate,Which, searching on tired pinion, foundBarren and cold repulse around;Oh, no! yet each one sorrow gaveNew graces to the narrow grave. For broken vows had early quelledThe stainless spirit's vestal flame;Yes! whilst the faithful bosom swelled,Then the envenomed arrow came,And Apathy's unaltering eye Beamed coldness on the misery;And early I had learned to scornThe chains of clay that bound a soulPanting to seize the wings of morn,And where its vital fires were born To soar, and spur the cold controlWhich the vile slaves of earthly nightWould twine around its struggling flight.Oh, many were the friends whom fameHad linked with the unmeaning name, Whose magic marked among mankindThe casket of my unknown mind,Which hidden from the vulgar glareImbibed no fleeting radiance there.My darksome spirit sought--it found A friendless solitude around.For who that might undaunted stand,The saviour of a sinking land,Would crawl, its ruthless tyrant's slave,And fatten upon Freedom's grave, Though doomed with her to perish, whereThe captive clasps abhorred despair.They could not share the bosom's feeling,Which, passion's every throb revealing,Dared force on the world's notice coldThoughts of unprofitable mould,Who bask in Custom's fickle ray,Fit sunshine of such wintry day!They could not in a twilight walkWeave an impassioned web of talk,Till mysteries the spirits pressIn wild yet tender awfulness,Then feel within our narrow sphereHow little yet how great we are!But they might shine in courtly glare,Attract the rabble's cheapest stare,And might command where'er they moveA thing that bears the name of love;They might be learned, witty, gay,Foremost in fashion's gilt array,On Fame's emblazoned pages shine,Be princes' friends, but never mine!Ye jagged peaks that frown sublime,Mocking the blunted scythe of Time,Whence I would watch its lustre pale Steal from the moon o'er yonder valeThou rock, whose bosom black and vast,Bared to the stream's unceasing flow,Ever its giant shade doth castOn the tumultuous surge below: Woods, to whose depths retires to dieThe wounded Echo's melody,And whither this lone spirit bentThe footstep of a wild intent:Meadows! whose green and spangled breastThese fevered limbs have often pressed,Until the watchful fiend DespairSlept in the soothing coolness there!Have not your varied beauties seenThe sunken eye, the withering mien, Sad traces of the unuttered painThat froze my heart and burned my brain.How changed since Nature's summer formHad last the power my grief to charm,Since last ye soothed my spirit's sadness, Strange chaos of a mingled madness!Changed!--not the loathsome worm that fedIn the dark mansions of the dead,Now soaring through the fields of air,And gathering purest nectar there, A butterfly, whose million huesThe dazzled eye of wonder views,Long lingering on a work so strange,Has undergone so bright a change.How do I feel my happiness? I cannot tell, but they may guessWhose every gloomy feeling gone,Friendship and passion feel alone;Who see mortality's dull cloudsBefore affection's murmur fly, Whilst the mild glances of her eyePierce the thin veil of flesh that shroudsThe spirit's inmost sanctuary.O thou! whose virtues latest known,First in this heart yet claim'st a throne; Whose downy sceptre still shall shareThe gentle sway with virtue there;Thou fair in form, and pure in mind,Whose ardent friendship rivets fastThe flowery band our fates that bind, Which incorruptible shall lastWhen duty's hard and cold controlHas thawed around the burning soul,--The gloomiest retrospects that bindWith crowns of thorn the bleeding mind, The prospects of most doubtful hueThat rise on Fancy's shuddering view,--Are gilt by the reviving rayWhich thou hast flung upon my day.

To Sophia (Miss Stacey),"                        I.Thou art fair, and few are fairerOf the Nymphs of earth or ocean;They are robes that fit the wearer--Those soft limbs of thine, whose motionEver falls and shifts and glances As the life within them dances.II.Thy deep eyes, a double Planet,Gaze the wisest into madnessWith soft clear fire,--the winds that fan itAre those thoughts of tender gladnessWhich, like zephyrs on the billow,Make thy gentle soul their pillow.III.If, whatever face thou paintestIn those eyes, grows pale with pleasure,If the fainting soul is faintest When it hears thy harp’s wild measure,Wonder not that when thou speakestOf the weak my heart is weakest.IV.As dew beneath the wind of morning,As the sea which whirlwinds waken,As the birds at thunder’s warning,As aught mute yet deeply shaken,As one who feels an unseen spiritIs my heart when thine is near it.

To The Lord Chancellor,"                        I.Thy country's curse is on thee, darkest crestOf that foul, knotted, many-headed wormWhich rends our Mother’s bosom—Priestly Pest!Masked Resurrection of a buried Form!II.Thy country's curse is on thee! Justice sold,Truth trampled, Nature’s landmarks overthrown,And heaps of fraud-accumulated gold,Plead, loud as thunder, at Destruction's throne.III.And whilst that sure slow Angel which aye standsWatching the beck of Mutability Delays to execute her high commands,And, though a nation weeps, spares thine and thee,IV.Oh, let a father's curse be on thy soul,And let a daughter's hope be on thy tomb;Be both, on thy gray head, a leaden cowlTo weigh thee down to thine approaching doom.V.I curse thee by a parent's outraged love,By hopes long cherished and too lately lost,By gentle feelings thou couldst never prove,By griefs which thy stern nature never crossed;VI.By those infantine smiles of happy light,Which were a fire within a stranger's hearth,Quenched even when kindled, in untimely nightHiding the promise of a lovely birth:VII.By those unpractised accents of young speech,Which he who is a father thought to frameTo gentlest lore, such as the wisest teach--THOU strike the lyre of mind!--oh, grief and shame!VIII.By all the happy see in children's growth--That undeveloped flower of budding years--Sweetness and sadness interwoven both,Source of the sweetest hopes and saddest fears--IX.By all the days, under an hireling's care,Of dull constraint and bitter heaviness,--O wretched ye if ever any were,--Sadder than orphans, yet not fatherless!X.By the false cant which on their innocent lipsMust hang like poison on an opening bloom,By the dark creeds which cover with eclipseTheir pathway from the cradle to the tomb--XI.By thy most impious Hell, and all its terror;By all the grief, the madness, and the guiltOf thine impostures, which must be their error--That sand on which thy crumbling power is built--XII.By thy complicity with lust and hate--Thy thirst for tears—thy hunger after gold--The ready frauds which ever on thee wait--The servile arts in which thou hast grown old--XIII.By thy most killing sneer, and by thy smile--By all the arts and snares of thy black den,And—for thou canst outweep the crocodile--By thy false tears—those millstones braining men--XIV.By all the hate which checks a father's love--By all the scorn which kills a fathe's care--By those most impious hands which dared removeNature’s high bounds--by thee--and by despair--XV.Yes, the despair which bids a father groan,And cry, 'My children are no longer mine--The blood within those veins may be mine own,But--Tyrant--their polluted souls are thine;— 60XVI.I curse thee--though I hate thee not.--O slave!If thou couldst quench the earth-consuming HellOf which thou art a daemon, on thy graveThis curse should be a blessing.

The Sepulchre Of Memory,"                        And where is truth? On tombs? for such to theeHas been my heart—and thy dead memoryHas lain from childhood, many a changeful year,Unchangingly preserved and buried there.                                             "
To Edward Williams,"                        I.The serpent is shut out from Paradise.The wounded deer must seek the herb no moreIn which its heart-cure lies:The widowed dove must cease to haunt a bowerLike that from which its mate with feigned sighs Fled in the April hour.I too must seldom seek againNear happy friends a mitigated pain.II.Of hatred I am proud,--with scorn content;Indifference, that once hurt me, now is grownItself indifferent;But, not to speak of love, pity aloneCan break a spirit already more than bent.The miserable oneTurns the mind’s poison into food,--Its medicine is tears,--its evil good.III.Therefore, if now I see you seldomer,Dear friends, dear FRIEND! know that I only flyYour looks, because they stirGriefs that should sleep, and hopes that cannot die:The very comfort that they ministerI scarce can bear, yet I,So deeply is the arrow gone,Should quickly perish if it were withdrawn.IV.When I return to my cold home, you ask Why I am not as I have ever been.YOU spoil me for the taskOf acting a forced part in life's dull scene,--Of wearing on my brow the idle maskOf author, great or mean,In the world's carnival. I soughtPeace thus, and but in you I found it not.V.Full half an hour, to-day, I tried my lotWith various flowers, and every one still said,'She loves me--loves me not.'And if this meant a vision long since fled--If it meant fortune, fame, or peace of thought--If it meant,--but I dreadTo speak what you may know too well:Still there was truth in the sad oracle. VI.The crane o'er seas and forests seeks her home;No bird so wild but has its quiet nest,When it no more would roam;The sleepless billows on the ocean’s breastBreak like a bursting heart, and die in foam, And thus at length find rest:Doubtless there is a place of peaceWhere MY weak heart and all its throbs will cease.VII.I asked her, yesterday, if she believedThat I had resolution. One who HAD Would ne’er have thus relievedHis heart with words,—but what his judgement badeWould do, and leave the scorner unrelieved.These verses are too sadTo send to you, but that I know, Happy yourself, you feel another’s woe.

To Harriet -- It Is Not Blasphemy To Hope That Heaven,"                        It is not blasphemy to hope that HeavenMore perfectly will give those nameless joysWhich throb within the pulses of the bloodAnd sweeten all that bitterness which EarthInfuses in the heaven-born soul. O thou Whose dear love gleamed upon the gloomy pathWhich this lone spirit travelled, drear and cold,Yet swiftly leading to those awful limitsWhich mark the bounds of Time and of the spaceWhen Time shall be no more; wilt thou not turn Those spirit-beaming eyes and look on me,Until I be assured that Earth is Heaven,And Heaven is Earth?--will not thy glowing cheek,Glowing with soft suffusion, rest on mine,And breathe magnetic sweetness through the frame Of my corporeal nature, through the soulNow knit with these fine fibres? I would giveThe longest and the happiest day that fateHas marked on my existence but to feelONE soul-reviving kiss...O thou most dear, 'Tis an assurance that this Earth is Heaven,And Heaven the flower of that untainted seedWhich springeth here beneath such love as ours.Harriet! let death all mortal ties dissolve,But ours shall not be mortal! The cold handOf Time may chill the love of earthly mindsHalf frozen now; the frigid intercourseOf common souls lives but a summer's day;It dies, where it arose, upon this earth.But ours! oh, 'tis the stretch of Fancy's hope To portray its continuance as now,Warm, tranquil, spirit-healing; nor when ageHas tempered these wild ecstasies, and givenA soberer tinge to the luxurious glowWhich blazing on devotion's pinnacle Makes virtuous passion supersede the powerOf reason; nor when life's aestival sunTo deeper manhood shall have ripened me;Nor when some years have added judgement's storeTo all thy woman sweetness, all the fireWhich throbs in thine enthusiast heart; not thenShall holy friendship (for what other nameMay love like ours assume?), not even thenShall Custom so corrupt, or the cold formsOf this desolate world so harden us,As when we think of the dear love that bindsOur souls in soft communion, while we knowEach other's thoughts and feelings, can we sayUnblushingly a heartless compliment,Praise, hate, or love with the unthinking world, Or dare to cut the unrelaxing nerveThat knits our love to virtue. Can those eyes,Beaming with mildest radiance on my heartTo purify its purity, e'er bendTo soothe its vice or consecrate its fears? Never, thou second Self! Is confidenceSo vain in virtue that I learn to doubtThe mirror even of Truth? Dark flood of Time,Roll as it listeth thee; I measure notBy month or moments thy ambiguous course. Another may stand by me on thy brink,And watch the bubble whirled beyond his ken,Which pauses at my feet. The sense of love,The thirst for action, and the impassioned thoughtProlong my being; if I wake no more, My life more actual living will containThan some gray veteran’s of the world's cold school,Whose listless hours unprofitably rollBy one enthusiast feeling unredeemed,Virtue and Love! unbending Fortitude,Freedom, Devotedness and Purity!That life my Spirit consecrates to you.

from Laon and Cythna; or The Revolution of the Golden City,"                                          To Mary — —                                          1.  So now my summer task is ended, Mary,       And I return to thee, mine own heart's home;   As to his Queen some victor Knight of Faëry,       Earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome;       Nor thou disdain, that ere my fame become   A star among the stars of mortal night,       If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom,   Its doubtful promise thus I would uniteWith thy beloved name, thou Child of love and light.                                         2.   The toil which stole from thee so many an hour       Is ended,—and the fruit is at thy feet!   No longer where the woods to frame a bower       With interlaced branches mix and meet,       Or where with sound like many voices sweet,   Water-falls leap among wild islands green,       Which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat   Of moss-grown trees and weeds, shall I be seen:But beside thee, where still my heart has ever been.                                         3.   Thoughts of great deeds were mine, dear Friend, when first       The clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass.   I do remember well the hour which burst       My spirit's sleep: a fresh May-dawn it was,       When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,   And wept, I knew not why; until there rose       From the near school-room, voices, that, alas!   Were but one echo from a world of woes—The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.                                         4.   And then I clasped my hands and looked around—       —But none was near to mock my streaming eyes,   Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground—       So without shame, I spake:—'I will be wise,       And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies   Such power, for I grow weary to behold       The selfish and the strong still tyrannise   Without reproach or check.' I then controuledMy tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.                                         5.   And from that hour did I with earnest thought       Heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore,   Yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught       I cared to learn, but from that secret store       Wrought linked armour for my soul, before   It might walk forth to war among mankind;       Thus power and hope were strengthened more and more   Within me, till there came upon my mindA sense of loneliness, a thirst with which I pined.                                         6.   Alas, that love should be a blight and snare       To those who seek all sympathies in one!—   Such once I sought in vain; then black despair,       The shadow of a starless night, was thrown       Over the world in which I moved alone:—   Yet never found I one not false to me,       Hard hearts, and cold, like weights of icy stone   Which crushed and withered mine, that could not beAught but a lifeless clog, until revived by thee.                                         7.   Thou Friend, whose presence on my wintry heart       Fell, like bright Spring upon some herbless plain;   How beautiful and calm and free thou wert       In thy young wisdom, when the mortal chain       Of Custom thou didst burst and rend in twain,   And walked as free as light the clouds among,       Which many an envious slave then breathed in vain   From his dim dungeon, and my spirit sprungTo meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long.                                         8.   No more alone through the world's wilderness,       Although I trod the paths of high intent,   I journeyed now: no more companionless,       Where solitude is like despair, I went.—       There is the wisdom of a stern content   When Poverty can blight the just and good,       When Infamy dares mock the innocent,   And cherished friends turn with the multitudeTo trample: this was ours, and we unshaken stood!                                         9.   Now has descended a serener hour,       And with inconstant fortune, friends return;   Though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power       Which says:—Let scorn be not repaid with scorn.       And from thy side two gentle babes are born   To fill our home with smiles, and thus are we      Most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn;   And these delights, and thou, have been to meThe parents of the Song I consecrate to thee.                                         10.   Is it, that now my inexperienced fingers       But strike the prelude of a loftier strain?   Or, must the lyre on which my spirit lingers       Soon pause in silence, ne'er to sound again,       Though it might shake the Anarch Custom's reign,   And charm the minds of men to Truth's own sway       Holier than was Amphion's? I would fain   Reply in hope—but I am worn away,And Death and Love are yet contending for their prey.                                         11.   And what art thou? I know, but dare not speak:       Time may interpret to his silent years.   Yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek,       And in the light thine ample forehead wears,       And in thy sweetest smiles, and in thy tears,  And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy       Is whispered, to subdue my fondest fears:   And through thine eyes, even in thy soul I seeA lamp of vestal fire burning internally.                                         12.   They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth,       Of glorious parents, thou aspiring Child.   I wonder not—for One then left this earth       Whose life was like a setting planet mild       Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled   Of its departing glory; still her fame       Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild   Which shake these latter days; and thou canst claimThe shelter, from thy Sire, of an immortal name.                                         13.   One voice came forth from many a mighty spirit,       Which was the echo of three thousand years;   And the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it,       As some lone man who in a desart hears       The music of his home:—unwonted fears   Fell on the pale oppressors of our race,       And Faith, and Custom, and low-thoughted cares,   Like thunder-stricken dragons, for a spaceLeft the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.                                         14.   Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!       If there must be no response to my cry—   If men must rise and stamp with fury blind       On his pure name who loves them,—thou and I,       Sweet Friend! can look from our tranquillity   Like lamps into the world's tempestuous night,—       Two tranquil stars, while clouds are passing by   Which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight,That burn from year to year with unextinguished light.

To Harriet,"                        Thy look of love has power to calmThe stormiest passion of my soul;Thy gentle words are drops of balmIn life's too bitter bowl;No grief is mine, but that aloneThese choicest blessings I have known.Harriet! if all who long to liveIn the warm sunshine of thine eye,That price beyond all pain must give,-Beneath thy scorn to die;Then hear thy chosen own too lateHis heart most worthy of thy hate.Be thou, then, one among mankindWhose heart is harder not for state,Thou only virtuous, gentle, kind,Amid a world of hate;And by a slight endurance sealA fellow-being's lasting weal.For pale with anguish is his cheek,His breath comes fast, his eyes are dim,Thy name is struggling ere he speak,Weak is each trembling limb;In mercy let him not endureThe misery of a fatal cure.Oh, trust for once no erring guide!Bid the remorseless feeling flee;'Tis malice, 'tis revenge, 'tis pride,'Tis anything but thee;Oh, deign a nobler pride to prove,And pity if thou canst not love.

The Wandering Jew's Soliloquy,"                        Is it the Eternal Triune, is it HeWho dares arrest the wheels of destinyAnd plunge me in the lowest Hell of Hells?Will not the lightning's blast destroy my frame?Will not steel drink the blood-life where it swells? No—let me hie where dark Destruction dwells,To rouse her from her deeply caverned lair,And, taunting her cursed sluggishness to ire,Light long Oblivion's death-torch at its flameAnd calmly mount Annihilation's pyre. Tyrant of Earth! pale Misery's jackal Thou!Are there no stores of vengeful violent fateWithin the magazines of Thy fierce hate?No poison in the clouds to bathe a browThat lowers on Thee with desperate contempt?Where is the noonday Pestilence that slewThe myriad sons of Israel's favoured nation?Where the destroying Minister that flewPouring the fiery tide of desolationUpon the leagued Assyrian's attempt?

Prithee, for this one time,Content thee with a visionary rhyme.II.What hand would crush the silken-wingèd fly,The youngest of inconstant April's minions,Because it cannot climb the purest sky,Where the swan sings, amid the sun's dominions?Not thine.

It is builtUpon some prison-homes, whose dwellers raveFor bread, and gold, and blood: Pain, linked to Guilt,Agitates the light flame of their hours,Until its vital oil is spent or spilt.There stands the pile, a tower amid the towers And sacred domes; each marble-ribbed roof,The brazen-gated temples, and the bowersOf solitary wealth,--the tempest-proofPavilions of the dark Italian air,--Are by its presence dimmed--they stand aloof, And are withdrawn—so that the world is bare;As if a spectre wrapped in shapeless terrorAmid a company of ladies fairShould glide and glow, till it became a mirrorOf all their beauty, and their hair and hue,The life of their sweet eyes, with all its error,Should be absorbed, till they to marble grew.

The Zucca,"                        I.Summer was dead and Autumn was expiring,And infant Winter laughed upon the landAll cloudlessly and cold;--when I, desiringMore in this world than any understand,Wept o’er the beauty, which, like sea retiring, Had left the earth bare as the wave-worn sandOf my lorn heart, and o’er the grass and flowersPale for the falsehood of the flattering Hours.II.Summer was dead, but I yet lived to weepThe instability of all but weeping; And on the Earth lulled in her winter sleepI woke, and envied her as she was sleeping.Too happy Earth! over thy face shall creepThe wakening vernal airs, until thou, leapingFrom unremembered dreams, shalt ... see No death divide thy immortality.III.I loved--oh, no, I mean not one of ye,Or any earthly one, though ye are dearAs human heart to human heart may be;--I loved, I know not what--but this low sphereAnd all that it contains, contains not thee,Thou, whom, seen nowhere, I feel everywhere.From Heaven and Earth, and all that in them are,Veiled art thou, like a ... star.IV.By Heaven and Earth, from all whose shapes thou flowest, Neither to be contained, delayed, nor hidden;Making divine the loftiest and the lowest,When for a moment thou art not forbiddenTo live within the life which thou bestowest;And leaving noblest things vacant and chidden, Cold as a corpse after the spirit’s flightBlank as the sun after the birth of night.V.In winds, and trees, and streams, and all things common,In music and the sweet unconscious toneOf animals, and voices which are human, Meant to express some feelings of their own;In the soft motions and rare smile of woman,In flowers and leaves, and in the grass fresh-shown,Or dying in the autumn, I the mostAdore thee present or lament thee lost. VI.And thus I went lamenting, when I sawA plant upon the river’s margin lieLike one who loved beyond his nature’s law,And in despair had cast him down to die;Its leaves, which had outlived the frost, the thaw Had blighted; like a heart which hatred’s eyeCan blast not, but which pity kills; the dewLay on its spotted leaves like tears too true.VII.The Heavens had wept upon it, but the EarthHad crushed it on her maternal breast...VIII.I bore it to my chamber, and I plantedIt in a vase full of the lightest mould;The winter beams which out of Heaven slantedFell through the window-panes, disrobed of cold,Upon its leaves and flowers; the stars which panted In evening for the Day, whose car has rolledOver the horizon’s wave, with looks of lightSmiled on it from the threshold of the night.IX.The mitigated influences of airAnd light revived the plant, and from it grew Strong leaves and tendrils, and its flowers fair,Full as a cup with the vine’s burning dew,O’erflowed with golden colours; an atmosphereOf vital warmth enfolded it anew,And every impulse sent to every partThe unbeheld pulsations of its heart.X.Well might the plant grow beautiful and strong,Even if the air and sun had smiled not on it;For one wept o’er it all the winter longTears pure as Heaven’s rain, which fell upon it Hour after hour; for sounds of softest songMixed with the stringed melodies that won itTo leave the gentle lips on which it slept,Had loosed the heart of him who sat and wept.XI.Had loosed his heart, and shook the leaves and flowers 75On which he wept, the while the savage stormWaked by the darkest of December’s hoursWas raving round the chamber hushed and warm;The birds were shivering in their leafless bowers,The fish were frozen in the pools, the form Of every summer plant was deadWhilst this....

The Spectral Horseman,"                        What was the shriek that struck Fancy's earAs it sate on the ruins of time that is past?Hark! it floats on the fitful blast of the wind,And breathes to the pale moon a funeral sigh.It is the Benshie's moan on the storm,Or a shivering fiend that thirsting for sin,Seeks murder and guilt when virtue sleeps,Winged with the power of some ruthless king,And sweeps o'er the breast of the prostrate plain.It was not a fiend from the regions of HellThat poured its low moan on the stillness of night:It was not a ghost of the guilty dead,Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore;But aye at the close of seven years' end,That voice is mixed with the swell of the storm,And aye at the close of seven years' end,A shapeless shadow that sleeps on the hillAwakens and floats on the mist of the heath.It is not the shade of a murdered man,Who has rushed uncalled to the throne of his God,And howls in the pause of the eddying storm.This voice is low, cold, hollow, and chill,'Tis not heard by the ear, but is felt in the soul.'Tis more frightful far than the death-daemon's scream,Or the laughter of fiends when they howl o’er the corpse Of a man who has sold his soul to Hell.It tells the approach of a mystic form,A white courser bears the shadowy sprite;More thin they are than the mists of the mountain,When the clear moonlight sleeps on the waveless lake. More pale HIS cheek than the snows of Nithona,When winter rides on the northern blast,And howls in the midst of the leafless wood.Yet when the fierce swell of the tempest is raving,And the whirlwinds howl in the caves of Inisfallen,Still secure mid the wildest war of the sky,The phantom courser scours the waste,And his rider howls in the thunder's roar.O'er him the fierce bolts of avenging HeavenPause, as in fear, to strike his head. The meteors of midnight recoil from his figure,Yet the 'wildered peasant, that oft passes by,With wonder beholds the blue flash through his form:And his voice, though faint as the sighs of the dead,The startled passenger shudders to hear, More distinct than the thunder's wildest roar.Then does the dragon, who, chained in the cavernsTo eternity, curses the champion of Erin,Moan and yell loud at the lone hour of midnight,And twine his vast wreaths round the forms of the daemons;Then in agony roll his death-swimming eyeballs,Though 'wildered by death, yet never to die!Then he shakes from his skeleton folds the nightmares,Who, shrieking in agony, seek the couchOf some fevered wretch who courts sleep in vain;Then the tombless ghosts of the guilty deadIn horror pause on the fitful gale.They float on the swell of the eddying tempest,And scared seek the caves of gigantic...Where their thin forms pour unearthly sounds On the blast that sweets the breast of the lake,And mingles its swell with the moonlight air.

The Pine Forest Of The Cascine Near Pisa,"                        Dearest, best and brightest,Come away,To the woods and to the fields!Dearer than this fairest dayWhich, like thee to those in sorrow,Comes to bid a sweet good-morrowTo the rough Year just awakeIn its cradle in the brake.The eldest of the Hours of Spring,Into the Winter wandering,Looks upon the leafless wood,And the banks all bare and rude;Found, it seems, this halcyon MornIn February’s bosom born,Bending from Heaven, in azure mirth,Kissed the cold forehead of the Earth,And smiled upon the silent sea,And bade the frozen streams be free;And waked to music all the fountains,And breathed upon the rigid mountains, And made the wintry world appearLike one on whom thou smilest, Dear.Radiant Sister of the Day,Awake! arise! and come away!To the wild woods and the plains, To the pools where winter rainsImage all the roof of leaves,Where the pine its garland weavesSapless, gray, and ivy dunRound stems that never kiss the sun--To the sandhills of the sea,Where the earliest violets be.Now the last day of many days,All beautiful and bright as thou,The loveliest and the last, is dead,Rise, Memory, and write its praise!And do thy wonted work and traceThe epitaph of glory fled;For now the Earth has changed its face,A frown is on the Heaven’s brow. We wandered to the Pine ForestThat skirts the Ocean's foam,The lightest wind was in its nest,The tempest in its home.The whispering waves were half asleep,The clouds were gone to play,And on the woods, and on the deepThe smile of Heaven lay.It seemed as if the day were oneSent from beyond the skies,Which shed to earth above the sunA light of Paradise.We paused amid the pines that stood,The giants of the waste,Tortured by storms to shapes as rude With stems like serpents interlaced.How calm it was--the silence thereBy such a chain was bound,That even the busy woodpeckerMade stiller by her sound The inviolable quietness;The breath of peace we drewWith its soft motion made not lessThe calm that round us grew.It seemed that from the remotest seat Of the white mountain's wasteTo the bright flower beneath our feet,A magic circle traced;--A spirit interfused around,A thinking, silent life; To momentary peace it boundOur mortal nature’s strife;--And still, it seemed, the centre ofThe magic circle there,Was one whose being filled with loveThe breathless atmosphere.Were not the crocuses that grewUnder that ilex-treeAs beautiful in scent and hueAs ever fed the bee?We stood beneath the pools that lieUnder the forest bough,And each seemed like a skyGulfed in a world below;A purple firmament of light Which in the dark earth lay,More boundless than the depth of night,And clearer than the day—In which the massy forests grewAs in the upper air,More perfect both in shape and hueThan any waving there.Like one beloved the scene had lentTo the dark water's breastIts every leaf and lineamentWith that clear truth expressed;There lay far glades and neighbouring lawn,And through the dark green crowdThe white sun twinkling like the dawnUnder a speckled cloud.Sweet views, which in our world aboveCan never well be seen,Were imaged by the water's loveOf that fair forest green.And all was interfused beneath With an Elysian air,An atmosphere without a breath,A silence sleeping there.Until a wandering wind crept by,Like an unwelcome thought, Which from my mind's too faithful eyeBlots thy bright image out.For thou art good and dear and kind,The forest ever green,But less of peace in S---'s mind,Than calm in waters, seen.

The Sensitive Plant,"                        PART 1.A Sensitive Plant in a garden grew,And the young winds fed it with silver dew,And it opened its fan-like leaves to the light.And closed them beneath the kisses of Night.And the Spring arose on the garden fair,Like the Spirit of Love felt everywhere;And each flower and herb on Earth’s dark breastRose from the dreams of its wintry rest.But none ever trembled and panted with blissIn the garden, the field, or the wilderness, Like a doe in the noontide with love’s sweet want,As the companionless Sensitive Plant.The snowdrop, and then the violet,Arose from the ground with warm rain wet,And their breath was mixed with fresh odour, sentFrom the turf, like the voice and the instrument.Then the pied wind-flowers and the tulip tall,And narcissi, the fairest among them all,Who gaze on their eyes in the stream’s recess,Till they die of their own dear loveliness;And the Naiad-like lily of the vale,Whom youth makes so fair and passion so paleThat the light of its tremulous bells is seenThrough their pavilions of tender green;And the hyacinth purple, and white, and blue,Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anewOf music so delicate, soft, and intense,It was felt like an odour within the sense;And the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed,Which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast, Till, fold after fold, to the fainting airThe soul of her beauty and love lay bare:And the wand-like lily, which lifted up,As a Maenad, its moonlight-coloured cup,Till the fiery star, which is its eye,Gazed through clear dew on the tender sky; And the jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose,The sweetest flower for scent that blows;And all rare blossoms from every climeGrew in that garden in perfect prime.And on the stream whose inconstant bosomWas pranked, under boughs of embowering blossom,With golden and green light, slanting throughTheir heaven of many a tangled hue,Broad water-lilies lay tremulously,And starry river-buds glimmered by,And around them the soft stream did glide and danceWith a motion of sweet sound and radiance.And the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss,Which led through the garden along and across,Some open at once to the sun and the breeze,Some lost among bowers of blossoming trees,Were all paved with daisies and delicate bellsAs fair as the fabulous asphodels,And flow’rets which, drooping as day drooped too,Fell into pavilions, white, purple, and blue,To roof the glow-worm from the evening dew.And from this undefiled ParadiseThe flowers (as an infant’s awakening eyesSmile on its mother, whose singing sweetCan first lull, and at last must awaken it),When Heaven’s blithe winds had unfolded them,As mine-lamps enkindle a hidden gem,Shone smiling to Heaven, and every oneShared joy in the light of the gentle sun;For each one was interpenetratedWith the light and the odour its neighbour shed,Like young lovers whom youth and love make dearWrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere.But the Sensitive Plant which could give small fruit Of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root,Received more than all, it loved more than ever,Where none wanted but it, could belong to the giver,—For the Sensitive Plant has no bright flower;Radiance and odour are not its dower;It loves, even like Love, its deep heart is full,It desires what it has not, the Beautiful!The light winds which from unsustaining wingsShed the music of many murmurings;The beams which dart from many a starOf the flowers whose hues they bear afar;The plumed insects swift and free,Like golden boats on a sunny sea,Laden with light and odour, which passOver the gleam of the living grass;The unseen clouds of the dew, which lieLike fire in the flowers till the sun rides high,Then wander like spirits among the spheres,Each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears;The quivering vapours of dim noontide, Which like a sea o’er the warm earth glide,In which every sound, and odour, and beam,Move, as reeds in a single stream;Each and all like ministering angels wereFor the Sensitive Plant sweet joy to bear,Whilst the lagging hours of the day went byLike windless clouds o’er a tender sky.And when evening descended from Heaven above,And the Earth was all rest, and the air was all love,And delight, though less bright, was far more deep,And the day’s veil fell from the world of sleep,And the beasts, and the birds, and the insects were drownedIn an ocean of dreams without a sound;Whose waves never mark, though they ever impressThe light sand which paves it, consciousness; (Only overhead the sweet nightingaleEver sang more sweet as the day might fail,And snatches of its Elysian chantWere mixed with the dreams of the Sensitive Plant);--The Sensitive Plant was the earliest Upgathered into the bosom of rest;A sweet child weary of its delight,The feeblest and yet the favourite,Cradled within the embrace of Night.PART 2.There was a Power in this sweet place,An Eve in this Eden; a ruling GraceWhich to the flowers, did they waken or dream,Was as God is to the starry scheme.A Lady, the wonder of her kind,Whose form was upborne by a lovely mindWhich, dilating, had moulded her mien and motionLike a sea-flower unfolded beneath the ocean,Tended the garden from morn to even:And the meteors of that sublunar Heaven,Like the lamps of the air when Night walks forth,Laughed round her footsteps up from the Earth!She had no companion of mortal race,But her tremulous breath and her flushing faceTold, whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes,That her dreams were less slumber than Paradise:As if some bright Spirit for her sweet sakeHad deserted Heaven while the stars were awake,As if yet around her he lingering were,Though the veil of daylight concealed him from her.Her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed;You might hear by the heaving of her breast,That the coming and going of the windBrought pleasure there and left passion behind.And wherever her aery footstep trod,Her trailing hair from the grassy sodErased its light vestige, with shadowy sweep,Like a sunny storm o’er the dark green deep.I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweetRejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;I doubt not they felt the spirit that cameFrom her glowing fingers through all their frame.She sprinkled bright water from the streamOn those that were faint with the sunny beam;And out of the cups of the heavy flowers She emptied the rain of the thunder-showers.She lifted their heads with her tender hands,And sustained them with rods and osier-bands;If the flowers had been her own infants, sheCould never have nursed them more tenderly. And all killing insects and gnawing worms,And things of obscene and unlovely forms,She bore, in a basket of Indian woof,Into the rough woods far aloof,--In a basket, of grasses and wild-flowers full, The freshest her gentle hands could pullFor the poor banished insects, whose intent,Although they did ill, was innocent.But the bee and the beamlike ephemerisWhose path is the lightning's, and soft moths that kissThe sweet lips of the flowers, and harm not, did sheMake her attendant angels be.And many an antenatal tomb,Where butterflies dream of the life to come,She left clinging round the smooth and darkEdge of the odorous cedar bark.This fairest creature from earliest SpringThus moved through the garden ministeringMi the sweet season of Summertide,And ere the first leaf looked brown—she died!PART 3.Three days the flowers of the garden fair,Like stars when the moon is awakened, were,Or the waves of Baiae, ere luminousShe floats up through the smoke of Vesuvius.And on the fourth, the Sensitive PlantFelt the sound of the funeral chant,And the steps of the bearers, heavy and slow,And the sobs of the mourners, deep and low;The weary sound and the heavy breath,And the silent motions of passing death,And the smell, cold, oppressive, and dank,Sent through the pores of the coffin-plank;The dark grass, and the flowers among the grass,Were bright with tears as the crowd did pass;From their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone, And sate in the pines, and gave groan for groan.The garden, once fair, became cold and foul,Like the corpse of her who had been its soul,Which at first was lovely as if in sleep,Then slowly changed, till it grew a heap To make men tremble who never weep.Swift Summer into the Autumn flowed,And frost in the mist of the morning rode,Though the noonday sun looked clear and bright,Mocking the spoil of the secret night.The rose-leaves, like flakes of crimson snow,Paved the turf and the moss below.The lilies were drooping, and white, and wan,Like the head and the skin of a dying man.And Indian plants, of scent and hueThe sweetest that ever were fed on dew,Leaf by leaf, day after day,Were massed into the common clay.And the leaves, brown, yellow, and gray, and red,And white with the whiteness of what is dead, Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed;Their whistling noise made the birds aghast.And the gusty winds waked the winged seeds,Out of their birthplace of ugly weeds,Till they clung round many a sweet flower’s stem, Which rotted into the earth with them.The water-blooms under the rivuletFell from the stalks on which they were set;And the eddies drove them here and there,As the winds did those of the upper air.Then the rain came down, and the broken stalksWere bent and tangled across the walks;And the leafless network of parasite bowersMassed into ruin; and all sweet flowers.Between the time of the wind and the snow All loathliest weeds began to grow,Whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck,Like the water-snake’s belly and the toad’s back.And thistles, and nettles, and darnels rank,And the dock, and henbane, and hemlock dank,Stretched out its long and hollow shank,And stifled the air till the dead wind stank.And plants, at whose names the verse feels loath,Filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth,Prickly, and pulpous, and blistering, and blue,Livid, and starred with a lurid dew.And agarics, and fungi, with mildew and mouldStarted like mist from the wet ground cold;Pale, fleshy, as if the decaying deadWith a spirit of growth had been animated! Spawn, weeds, and filth, a leprous scum,Made the running rivulet thick and dumb,And at its outlet flags huge as stakesDammed it up with roots knotted like water-snakes.And hour by hour, when the air was still,The vapours arose which have strength to kill;At morn they were seen, at noon they were felt,At night they were darkness no star could melt.And unctuous meteors from spray to sprayCrept and flitted in broad noonday Unseen; every branch on which they alitBy a venomous blight was burned and bit.The Sensitive Plant, like one forbid,Wept, and the tears within each lidOf its folded leaves, which together grew,Were changed to a blight of frozen glue.For the leaves soon fell, and the branches soonBy the heavy axe of the blast were hewn;The sap shrank to the root through every poreAs blood to a heart that will beat no more.For Winter came: the wind was his whip:One choppy finger was on his lip:He had torn the cataracts from the hillsAnd they clanked at his girdle like manacles;His breath was a chain which without a soundThe earth, and the air, and the water bound;He came, fiercely driven, in his chariot-throneBy the tenfold blasts of the Arctic zone.Then the weeds which were forms of living deathFled from the frost to the earth beneath.Their decay and sudden flight from frostWas but like the vanishing of a ghost!And under the roots of the Sensitive PlantThe moles and the dormice died for want:The birds dropped stiff from the frozen airAnd were caught in the branches naked and bare.First there came down a thawing rainAnd its dull drops froze on the boughs again;Then there steamed up a freezing dewWhich to the drops of the thaw-rain grew; And a northern whirlwind, wandering aboutLike a wolf that had smelt a dead child out,Shook the boughs thus laden, and heavy, and stiff,And snapped them off with his rigid griff.When Winter had gone and Spring came backThe Sensitive Plant was a leafless wreck;But the mandrakes, and toadstools, and docks, and darnels,Rose like the dead from their ruined charnels.CONCLUSION.Whether the Sensitive Plant, or thatWhich within its boughs like a Spirit sat, Ere its outward form had known decay,Now felt this change, I cannot say.Whether that Lady’s gentle mind,No longer with the form combinedWhich scattered love, as stars do light,Found sadness, where it left delight,I dare not guess; but in this lifeOf error, ignorance, and strife,Where nothing is, but all things seem,And we the shadows of the dream,It is a modest creed, and yetPleasant if one considers it,To own that death itself must be,Like all the rest, a mockery.That garden sweet, that lady fair,And all sweet shapes and odours there,In truth have never passed away:’Tis we, ’tis ours, are changed; not they.For love, and beauty, and delight,There is no death nor change: their might Exceeds our organs, which endureNo light, being themselves obscure.

III.We paused amid the pines that stoodThe giants of the waste,Tortured by storms to shapes as rudeAs serpents interlaced;And, soothed by every azure breath,That under Heaven is blown,To harmonies and hues beneath,As tender as its own,Now all the tree-tops lay asleep,Like green waves on the sea,As still as in the silent deepThe ocean woods may be.IV.How calm it was!—the silence thereBy such a chain was boundThat even the busy woodpecker Made stiller by her soundThe inviolable quietness;The breath of peace we drewWith its soft motion made not lessThe calm that round us grew.There seemed from the remotest seatOf the white mountain waste,To the soft flower beneath our feet,A magic circle traced,--A spirit interfused around A thrilling, silent life,--To momentary peace it boundOur mortal nature’s strife;And still I felt the centre ofThe magic circle thereWas one fair form that filled with loveThe lifeless atmosphere.V.We paused beside the pools that lieUnder the forest bough,--Each seemed as ’twere a little skyGulfed in a world below;A firmament of purple lightWhich in the dark earth lay,More boundless than the depth of night,And purer than the day--In which the lovely forests grew,As in the upper air,More perfect both in shape and hueThan any spreading there.There lay the glade and neighbouring lawn,And through the dark green woodThe white sun twinkling like the dawnOut of a speckled cloud.Sweet views which in our world aboveCan never well be seen,Were imaged by the water’s loveOf that fair forest green.And all was interfused beneathWith an Elysian glow,An atmosphere without a breath, A softer day below.Like one beloved the scene had lentTo the dark water’s breast,Its every leaf and lineamentWith more than truth expressed; Until an envious wind crept by,Like an unwelcome thought,Which from the mind’s too faithful eyeBlots one dear image out.Though thou art ever fair and kind, The forests ever green,Less oft is peace in Shelley’s mind,Than calm in waters, seen.

The Sunset,"                        There late was One within whose subtle being,As light and wind within some delicate cloudThat fades amid the blue noon's burning sky,Genius and death contended. None may knowThe sweetness of the joy which made his breathFail, like the trances of the summer air,When, with the Lady of his love, who thenFirst knew the unreserve of mingled being,He walked along the pathway of a fieldWhich to the east a hoar wood shadowed o'er,But to the west was open to the sky.There now the sun had sunk, but lines of goldHung on the ashen clouds, and on the pointsOf the far level grass and nodding flowersAnd the old dandelion's hoary beard,And, mingled with the shades of twilight, layOn the brown massy woods -- and in the eastThe broad and burning moon lingeringly roseBetween the black trunks of the crowded trees,While the faint stars were gathering overhead--'Is it not strange, Isabel,' said the youth,'I never saw the sun? We will walk hereTo-morrow; thou shalt look on it with me.'That night the youth and lady mingled layIn love and sleep--but when the morning cameThe lady found her lover dead and cold.Let none believe that God in mercy gaveThat stroke. The lady died not, nor grew wild,But year by year lived on--in truth I thinkHer gentleness and patience and sad smiles,And that she did not die, but lived to tendHer agèd father, were a kind of madness,If madness 'tis to be unlike the world.For but to see her were to read the taleWoven by some subtlest bard, to make hard heartsDissolve away in wisdom-working grief;--Her eyes were black and lustreless and wan:Her eyelashes were worn away with tears,Her lips and cheeks were like things dead--so pale;Her hands were thin, and through their wandering veinsAnd weak articulations might be seenDay's ruddy light. The tomb of thy dead selfWhich one vexed ghost inhabits, night and day,Is all, lost child, that now remains of thee!'Inheritor of more than earth can give,Passionless calm and silence unreproved,Whether the dead find, oh, not sleep! but rest,And are the uncomplaining things they seem,Or live, or drop in the deep sea of Love;Oh, that like thine, mine epitaph were-- Peace!'This was the only moan she ever made.

I wept not—turned within to stone.They wept aloud, and little Anselm mine,Said—’twas my youngest, dearest little one,--“What ails thee, father? Why look so at thine?”In all that day, and all the following night,I wept not, nor replied; but when to shineUpon the world, not us, came forth the lightOf the new sun, and thwart my prison thrown Gleamed through its narrow chink, a doleful sight,‘Three faces, each the reflex of my own,Were imaged by its faint and ghastly ray;’Then I, of either hand unto the bone,Gnawed, in my agony; and thinking they Twas done from sudden pangs, in their excess,All of a sudden raise themselves, and say,“Father! our woes, so great, were yet the lessWould you but eat of us,—twas ‘you who cladOur bodies in these weeds of wretchedness; Despoil them’.” Not to make their hearts more sad,I ‘hushed’ myself. That day is at its close,--Another—still we were all mute. Oh, hadThe obdurate earth opened to end our woes!The fourth day dawned, and when the new sun shone, Outstretched himself before me as it roseMy Gaddo, saying, “Help, father! hast thou noneFor thine own child—is there no help from thee?”He died—there at my feet—and one by one,I saw them fall, plainly as you see me.

Marianne's Dream,"                        1.A pale Dream came to a Lady fair,And said, A boon, a boon, I pray!I know the secrets of the air,And things are lost in the glare of day,Which I can make the sleeping see,If they will put their trust in me.2.And thou shalt know of things unknown,If thou wilt let me rest betweenThe veiny lids, whose fringe is thrownOver thine eyes so dark and sheen: And half in hope, and half in fright,The Lady closed her eyes so bright.3.At first all deadly shapes were drivenTumultuously across her sleep,And o’er the vast cope of bending heavenAll ghastly-visaged clouds did sweep;And the Lady ever looked to spyIf the golden sun shone forth on high.4.And as towards the east she turned,She saw aloft in the morning air,Which now with hues of sunrise burned,A great black Anchor rising there;And wherever the Lady turned her eyes,It hung before her in the skies.5.The sky was blue as the summer sea,The depths were cloudless overhead,The air was calm as it could be,There was no sight or sound of dread,But that black Anchor floating stillOver the piny eastern hill.6.The Lady grew sick with a weight of fearTo see that Anchor ever hanging,And veiled her eyes; she then did hearThe sound as of a dim low clanging,And looked abroad if she might knowWas it aught else, or but the flowOf the blood in her own veins, to and fro.7.There was a mist in the sunless air,Which shook as it were with an earthquake’s shock,But the very weeds that blossomed thereWere moveless, and each mighty rockStood on its basis steadfastly;The Anchor was seen no more on high.8.But piled around, with summits hidIn lines of cloud at intervals,Stood many a mountain pyramidAmong whose everlasting wallsTwo mighty cities shone, and everThrough the red mist their domes did quiver.9.On two dread mountains, from whose crest,Might seem, the eagle, for her brood,Would ne’er have hung her dizzy nest,Those tower-encircled cities stood.A vision strange such towers to see,Sculptured and wrought so gorgeously,Where human art could never be.10.And columns framed of marble white,And giant fanes, dome over domePiled, and triumphant gates, all brightWith workmanship, which could not comeFrom touch of mortal instrument,Shot o’er the vales, or lustre lentFrom its own shapes magnificent.11.But still the Lady heard that clangFilling the wide air far away;And still the mist whose light did hangAmong the mountains shook alway,So that the Lady’s heart beat fast,As half in joy, and half aghast,On those high domes her look she cast.12.Sudden, from out that city sprungA light that made the earth grow red;Two flames that each with quivering tongueLicked its high domes, and overheadAmong those mighty towers and fanesDropped fire, as a volcano rainsIts sulphurous ruin on the plains.13.And hark! a rush as if the deepHad burst its bonds; she looked behindAnd saw over the western steepA raging flood descend, and windThrough that wide vale; she felt no fear,But said within herself, ’Tis clearThese towers are Nature’s own, and sheTo save them has sent forth the sea.14.And now those raging billows cameWhere that fair Lady sate, and sheWas borne towards the showering flameBy the wild waves heaped tumultuously.And, on a little plank, the flowOf the whirlpool bore her to and fro.15.The flames were fiercely vomitedFrom every tower and every dome,And dreary light did widely shedO’er that vast flood’s suspended foam,Beneath the smoke which hung its nightOn the stained cope of heaven’s light.16.The plank whereon that Lady sateWas driven through the chasms, about and about,Between the peaks so desolateOf the drowning mountains, in and out,As the thistle-beard on a whirlwind sails—While the flood was filling those hollow vales.17.At last her plank an eddy crossed,And bore her to the city’s wall,Which now the flood had reached almost;It might the stoutest heart appalTo hear the fire roar and hissThrough the domes of those mighty palaces.18.The eddy whirled her round and roundBefore a gorgeous gate, which stoodPiercing the clouds of smoke which boundIts aery arch with light like blood;She looked on that gate of marble clear,With wonder that extinguished fear.19.For it was filled with sculptures rarest,Of forms most beautiful and strange,Like nothing human, but the fairestOf winged shapes, whose legions rangeThroughout the sleep of those that are,Like this same Lady, good and fair.20.And as she looked, still lovelier grewThose marble forms;—the sculptor sureWas a strong spirit, and the hueOf his own mind did there endureAfter the touch, whose power had braidedSuch grace, was in some sad change faded.21.She looked, the flames were dim, the floodGrew tranquil as a woodland riverWinding through hills in solitude;Those marble shapes then seemed to quiver,And their fair limbs to float in motion,Like weeds unfolding in the ocean.22.And their lips moved; one seemed to speak,When suddenly the mountains cracked,And through the chasm the flood did breakWith an earth-uplifting cataract:The statues gave a joyous scream,And on its wings the pale thin DreamLifted the Lady from the stream.23.The dizzy flight of that phantom paleWaked the fair Lady from her sleep,And she arose, while from the veilOf her dark eyes the Dream did creep,And she walked about as one who knewThat sleep has sights as clear and trueAs any waking eyes can view.

There is a point of strandNear Vado’s tower and town; and on one sideThe treacherous marsh divides it from the land,Shadowed by pine and ilex forests wide, And on the other, creeps eternally,Through muddy weeds, the shallow sullen sea.XVI.Here the earth’s breath is pestilence, and fewBut things whose nature is at war with life--Snakes and ill worms—endure its mortal dew.The trophies of the clime’s victorious strife--And ringed horns which the buffalo did wear,And the wolf’s dark gray scalp who tracked him there.XVII.And at the utmost point...stood thereThe relics of a reed-inwoven cot, 95Thatched with broad flags. An outlawed murdererHad lived seven days there: the pursuit was hotWhen he was cold. The birds that were his graveFell dead after their feast in Vado’s wave.XVIII.There must have burned within Marenghi’s breast That fire, more warm and bright than life and hope,(Which to the martyr makes his dungeon...More joyous than free heaven’s majestic copeTo his oppressor), warring with decay,--Or he could ne’er have lived years, day by day.XIX.Nor was his state so lone as you might think.He had tamed every newt and snake and toad,And every seagull which sailed down to drinkThose freshes ere the death-mist went abroad.And each one, with peculiar talk and play, Wiled, not untaught, his silent time away.XX.And the marsh-meteors, like tame beasts, at nightCame licking with blue tongues his veined feet;And he would watch them, as, like spirits bright,In many entangled figures quaint and sweet To some enchanted music they would dance--Until they vanished at the first moon-glance.XXI.He mocked the stars by grouping on each weedThe summer dew-globes in the golden dawn;And, ere the hoar-frost languished, he could readIts pictured path, as on bare spots of lawnIts delicate brief touch in silver weavesThe likeness of the wood’s remembered leaves.XXII.And many a fresh Spring morn would he awaken--While yet the unrisen sun made glow, like ironQuivering in crimson fire, the peaks unshakenOf mountains and blue isles which did environWith air-clad crags that plain of land and sea,--And feel ... liberty.XXIII.And in the moonless nights when the dun oceanHeaved underneath wide heaven, star-impearled,Starting from dreams...Communed with the immeasurable world;And felt his life beyond his limbs dilated,Till his mind grew like that it contemplated.

When memory came(For years gone by leave each a deepening shade),His spirit basked in its internal flame,--As, when the black storm hurries round at night,The fisher basks beside his red firelight.XXVI.Yet human hopes and cares and faiths and errors,Like billows unawakened by the wind,Slept in Marenghi still; but that all terrors,Weakness, and doubt, had withered in his mind.His couch......XXVII.And, when he saw beneath the sunset’s planetA black ship walk over the crimson ocean,--Its pennon streaming on the blasts that fan it,Its sails and ropes all tense and without motion,Like the dark ghost of the unburied evenStriding athwart the orange-coloured heaven,--XXVIII.The thought of his own kind who made the soulWhich sped that winged shape through night and day,--The thought of his own country......

"Epipsychidion: Passages Of The Poem, Or Connected Therewith","                        Here, my dear friend, is a new book for you;I have already dedicated twoTo other friends, one female and one male,--What you are, is a thing that I must veil;What can this be to those who praise or rail?I never was attached to that great sectWhose doctrine is that each one should selectOut of the world a mistress or a friend,And all the rest, though fair and wise, commendTo cold oblivion-though 'tis in the codeOf modern morals, and the beaten roadWhich those poor slaves with weary footsteps treadWho travel to their home among the deadBy the broad highway of the world-and soWith one sad friend, and many a jealous foe,The dreariest and the longest journey go.Free love has this, different from gold and clay,That to divide is not to take away.Like ocean, which the general north wind breaksInto ten thousand waves, and each one makesA mirror of the moon -- like some great glass,Which did distort whatever form might pass,Dashed into fragments by a playful child,Which then reflects its eyes and forehead mild;Giving for one, which it could ne'er express,A thousand images of loveliness.If I were one whom the loud world held wise,I should disdain to quote authoritiesIn commendation of this kind of love:--Why there is first the God in heaven above,Who wrote a book called Nature, 'tis to beReviewed, I hear, in the next Quarterly;And Socrates, the Jesus Christ of Greece,And Jesus Christ Himself, did never ceaseTo urge all living things to love each other,And to forgive their mutual faults, and smotherThe Devil of disunion in their souls.. . .I love you!-- Listen, O embodied RayOf the great Brightness; I must pass awayWhile you remain, and these light words must beTokens by which you may remember me.Start not-the thing you are is unbetrayed,If you are human, and if but the shadeOf some sublimer spirit . . .. . .And as to friend or mistress, 'tis a form;Perhaps I wish you were one. Some declareYou a familiar spirit, as you are;Others with a . . . more inhumanHint that, though not my wife, you are a woman;What is the colour of your eyes and hair?Why, if you were a lady, it were fairThe world should know-but, as I am afraid,The Quarterly would bait you if betrayed;And if, as it will be sport to see them stumbleOver all sorts of scandals, hear them mumbleTheir litany of curses-some guess right,And others swear you're a Hermaphrodite;Like that sweet marble monster of both sexes,Which looks so sweet and gentle that it vexesThe very soul that the soul is goneWhich lifted from her limbs the veil of stone.. . .It is a sweet thing, friendship, a dear balm,A happy and auspicious bird of calm,Which rides o'er life's ever tumultuous Ocean;A God that broods o'er chaos in commotion;A flower which fresh as Lapland roses are,Lifts its bold head into the world's frore air,And blooms most radiantly when others die,Health, hope, and youth, and brief prosperity;And with the light and odour of its bloom,Shining within the dungeon and the tomb;Whose coming is as light and music are'Mid dissonance and gloom -- a starWhich moves not 'mid the moving heavens alone--A smile among dark frowns-a gentle toneAmong rude voices, a belovèd light,A solitude, a refuge, a delight.If I had but a friend! Why, I have threeEven by my own confession; there may beSome more, for what I know, for 'tis my mindTo call my friends all who are wise and kind,--And these, Heaven knows, at best are very few;But none can ever be more dear than you.Why should they be? My muse has lost her wings,Or like a dying swan who soars and sings,I should describe you in heroic style,But as it is, are you not void of guile?A lovely soul, formed to be blessed and bless:A well of sealed and secret happiness;A lute which those whom Love has taught to playMake music on to cheer the roughest day,And enchant sadness till it sleeps? . . .. . .To the oblivion whither I and thou,All loving and all lovely, hasten nowWith steps, ah, too unequal! may we meetIn one Elysium or one winding-sheet!If any should be curious to discoverWhether to you I am a friend or lover,Let them read Shakespeare's sonnets, taking thenceA whetstone for their dull intelligenceThat tears and will not cut, or let them guessHow Diotima, the wise prophetess,Instructed the instructor, and why heRebuked the infant spirit of melodyOn Agathon's sweet lips, which as he spokeWas as the lovely star when morn has brokeThe roof of darkness, in the golden dawn,Half-hidden, and yet beautiful.I'll pawnMy hopes of Heaven-you know what they are worth--That the presumptuous pedagogues of Earth,If they could tell the riddle offered hereWould scorn to be, or being to appearWhat now they seem and are -- but let them chide,They have few pleasures in the world beside;Perhaps we should be dull were we not chidden,Paradise fruits are sweetest when forbidden.Folly can season Wisdom, Hatred Love.. . .Farewell, if it can be to say farewellTo those who . . .. . .I will not, as most dedicators do,Assure myself and all the world and you,That you are faultless -- would to God they wereWho taunt me with your love! I then should wearThese heavy chains of life with a light spirit,And would to God I were, or even as near itAs you, dear heart. Alas! what are we? CloudsDriven by the wind in warring multitudes,Which rain into the bosom of the earth,And rise again, and in our death and birth,And through our restless life, take as from heavenHues which are not our own, but which are given,And then withdrawn, and with inconstant glanceFlash from the spirit to the countenance.There is a Power, a Love, a Joy, a GodWhich makes in mortal hearts its brief abode,A Pythian exhalation, which inspiresLove, only love -- a wind which o'er the wiresOf the soul's giant harpThere is a mood which language faints beneath;You feel it striding, as Almighty DeathHis bloodless steed . . .. . .And what is that most brief and bright delightWhich rushes through the touch and through the sight,And stands before the spirit's inmost throne,A naked Seraph? None hath ever known.Its birth is darkness, and its growth desire;Untameable and fleet and fierce as fire,Not to be touched but to be felt alone,It fills the world with glory -- and is gone.. . .It floats with rainbow pinions o'er the streamOf life, which flows, like a . . . dreamInto the light of morning, to the graveAs to an ocean . . .. . .What is that joy which serene infancyPerceives not, as the hours content them by,Each in a chain of blossoms, yet enjoysThe shapes of this new world, in giant toysWrought by the busy . . . ever new?Remembrance borrows Fancy's glass, to showThese forms more . . . sincereThan now they are, than then, perhaps, they were.When everything familiar seemed to beWonderful, and the immortalityOf this great world, which all things must inherit,Was felt as one with the awakening spirit,Unconscious of itself, and of the strangeDistinctions which in its proceeding changeIt feels and knows, and mourns as if each wereA desolation . . .. . .Were it not a sweet refuge, Emily,For all those exiles from the dull insaneWho vex this pleasant world with pride and pain,For all that band of sister-spirits knownTo one another by a voiceless tone?. . .If day should part us night will mend divisionAnd if sleep parts us -- we will meet in visionAnd if life parts us -- we will mix in deathYielding our mite [?] of unreluctant breathDeath cannot part us -- we must meet againIn all in nothing in delight in pain:How, why or when or where-it matters notSo that we share an undivided lot . . .. . .And we will move possessing and possessedWherever beauty on the earth's bare [?] breastLies like the shadow of thy soul -- till weBecome one being with the world we see . . .

Consider now, Is it a dream of which I speak to thee?By Jove it is not, for you have the trophies!And now I suffer more than all before.For when I heard that Juno had devisedA tedious voyage for you, I put to sea With all my children quaint in search of you,And I myself stood on the beaked prowAnd fixed the naked mast; and all my boysLeaning upon their oars, with splash and strainMade white with foam the green and purple sea,--And so we sought you, king. We were sailingNear Malea, when an eastern wind arose,And drove us to this waste Aetnean rock;The one-eyed children of the Ocean God,The man-destroying Cyclopses, inhabit, On this wild shore, their solitary caves,And one of these, named Polypheme. has caught usTo be his slaves; and so, for all delightOf Bacchic sports, sweet dance and melody,We keep this lawless giant’s wandering flocks.My sons indeed on far declivities,Young things themselves, tend on the youngling sheep,But I remain to fill the water-casks,Or sweeping the hard floor, or ministeringSome impious and abominable meal To the fell Cyclops. I am wearied of it!And now I must scrape up the littered floorWith this great iron rake, so to receiveMy absent master and his evening sheepIn a cave neat and clean. Even now I see My children tending the flocks hitherward.Ha! what is this? are your Sicinnian measuresEven now the same, as when with dance and songYou brought young Bacchus to Althaea’s halls?CHORUS OF SATYRS:STROPHE:Where has he of race divine Wandered in the winding rocks?Here the air is calm and fineFor the father of the flocks;--Here the grass is soft and sweet,And the river-eddies meet In the trough beside the cave,Bright as in their fountain wave.--Neither here, nor on the dewOf the lawny uplands feeding?Oh, you come!—a stone at you Will I throw to mend your breeding;--Get along, you horned thing,Wild, seditious, rambling!EPODE:An Iacchic melodyTo the golden Aphrodite Will I lift, as erst did ISeeking her and her delightWith the Maenads, whose white feetTo the music glance and fleet.Bacchus, O beloved, where, Shaking wide thy yellow hair,Wanderest thou alone, afar?To the one-eyed Cyclops, we,Who by right thy servants are,Minister in misery, In these wretched goat-skins clad,Far from thy delights and thee.SILENUS:Be silent, sons; command the slaves to driveThe gathered flocks into the rock-roofed cave.CHORUS:Go! But what needs this serious haste, O father? SILENUS:I see a Grecian vessel on the coast,And thence the rowers with some generalApproaching to this cave.—About their necksHang empty vessels, as they wanted food,And water-flasks.—Oh, miserable strangers!Whence come they, that they know not what and whoMy master is, approaching in ill hourThe inhospitable roof of Polypheme,And the Cyclopian jaw-bone, man-destroying?Be silent, Satyrs, while I ask and hear 85Whence coming, they arrive the Aetnean hill.ULYSSES:Friends, can you show me some clear water-spring,The remedy of our thirst? Will any oneFurnish with food seamen in want of it?Ha! what is this? We seem to be arrived At the blithe court of Bacchus. I observeThis sportive band of Satyrs near the caves.First let me greet the elder.--Hail!SILENUS:Hail thou,O Stranger! tell thy country and thy race.ULYSSES:The Ithacan Ulysses and the king Of Cephalonia.SILENUS:Oh! I know the man,Wordy and shrewd, the son of Sisyphus.ULYSSES:I am the same, but do not rail upon me.--SILENUS:Whence sailing do you come to Sicily?ULYSSES:From Ilion, and from the Trojan toils. SILENUS:How, touched you not at your paternal shore?ULYSSES:The strength of tempests bore me here by force.SILENUS:The self-same accident occurred to me.ULYSSES:Were you then driven here by stress of weather?SILENUS:Following the Pirates who had kidnapped Bacchus. ULYSSES:What land is this, and who inhabit it?--SILENUS:Aetna, the loftiest peak in Sicily.ULYSSES:And are there walls, and tower-surrounded towns?SILENUS:There are not.--These lone rocks are bare of men.ULYSSES:And who possess the land? the race of beasts?SILENUS:Cyclops, who live in caverns, not in houses.ULYSSES:Obeying whom? Or is the state popular?SILENUS:Shepherds: no one obeys any in aught.ULYSSES:How live they? do they sow the corn of Ceres?SILENUS:On milk and cheese, and on the flesh of sheep.ULYSSES:Have they the Bromian drink from the vine’s stream?SILENUS:Ah! no; they live in an ungracious land.ULYSSES:And are they just to strangers?—hospitable?SILENUS:They think the sweetest thing a stranger bringsIs his own flesh.ULYSSES:What! do they eat man’s flesh? SILENUS:No one comes here who is not eaten up.ULYSSES:The Cyclops now--where is he? Not at home?SILENUS:Absent on Aetna, hunting with his dogs.ULYSSES:Know’st thou what thou must do to aid us hence?SILENUS:I know not: we will help you all we can. ULYSSES:Provide us food, of which we are in want.SILENUS:Here is not anything, as I said, but meat.ULYSSES:But meat is a sweet remedy for hunger.SILENUS:Cow’s milk there is, and store of curdled cheese.ULYSSES:Bring out:--I would see all before I bargain. SILENUS:But how much gold will you engage to give?ULYSSES:I bring no gold, but Bacchic juice.SILENUS:Oh, joy!Tis long since these dry lips were wet with wine.ULYSSES:Maron, the son of the God, gave it me.SILENUS:Whom I have nursed a baby in my arms.ULYSSES:The son of Bacchus, for your clearer knowledge.SILENUS:Have you it now?—or is it in the ship?ULYSSES:Old man, this skin contains it, which you see.SILENUS:Why, this would hardly be a mouthful for me.ULYSSES:Nay, twice as much as you can draw from thence.SILENUS:You speak of a fair fountain, sweet to me.ULYSSES:Would you first taste of the unmingled wine?SILENUS:’Tis just—tasting invites the purchaser.ULYSSES:Here is the cup, together with the skin.SILENUS:Pour: that the draught may fillip my remembrance.ULYSSES:See! SILENUS:Papaiapax! what a sweet smell it has!ULYSSES:You see it then?--SILENUS:By Jove, no! but I smell it.ULYSSES:Taste, that you may not praise it in words only.SILENUS:Babai! Great Bacchus calls me forth to dance!Joy! joy!ULYSSES:Did it flow sweetly down your throat? SILENUS:So that it tingled to my very nails.ULYSSES:And in addition I will give you gold.SILENUS:Let gold alone! only unlock the cask.ULYSSES:Bring out some cheeses now, or a young goat.SILENUS:That will I do, despising any master.Yes, let me drink one cup, and I will giveAll that the Cyclops feed upon their mountains....CHORUS:Ye have taken Troy and laid your hands on Helen?ULYSSES:And utterly destroyed the race of Priam....SILENUS:The wanton wretch! she was bewitched to see The many-coloured anklets and the chainOf woven gold which girt the neck of Paris,And so she left that good man Menelaus.There should be no more women in the worldBut such as are reserved for me alone.--See, here are sheep, and here are goats, Ulysses,Here are unsparing cheeses of pressed milk;Take them; depart with what good speed ye may;First leaving my reward, the Bacchic dewOf joy-inspiring grapes.ULYSSES:Ah me! Alas!What shall we do? the Cyclops is at hand!Old man, we perish! whither can we fly?SILENUS:Hide yourselves quick within that hollow rock.ULYSSES:’Twere perilous to fly into the net.SILENUS:The cavern has recesses numberless; Hide yourselves quick.ULYSSES:That will I never do!The mighty Troy would be indeed disgracedIf I should fly one man. How many timesHave I withstood, with shield immovable.Ten thousand Phrygians!—if I needs must die, Yet will I die with glory;--if I live,The praise which I have gained will yet remain.SILENUS:What, ho! assistance, comrades, haste, assistance![THE CYCLOPS, SILENUS, ULYSSES; CHORUS.]CYCLOPS:What is this tumult? Bacchus is not here,Nor tympanies nor brazen castanets. How are my young lambs in the cavern? MilkingTheir dams or playing by their sides? And isThe new cheese pressed into the bulrush baskets?Speak! I’ll beat some of you till you rain tears--Look up, not downwards when I speak to you. SILENUS:See! I now gape at Jupiter himself;I stare upon Orion and the stars.CYCLOPS:Well, is the dinner fitly cooked and laid?SILENUS:All ready, if your throat is ready too.CYCLOPS:Are the bowls full of milk besides?SILENUS:O’er-brimming;So you may drink a tunful if you will.CYCLOPS:Is it ewe’s milk or cow’s milk, or both mixed?--SILENUS:Both, either; only pray don’t swallow me.CYCLOPS:By no means.--...What is this crowd I see beside the stalls? Outlaws or thieves? for near my cavern-homeI see my young lambs coupled two by twoWith willow bands; mixed with my cheeses lieTheir implements; and this old fellow hereHas his bald head broken with stripes.SILENUS:Ah me! I have been beaten till I burn with fever.CYCLOPS:By whom? Who laid his fist upon your head?SILENUS:Those men, because I would not suffer themTo steal your goods.CYCLOPS:Did not the rascals knowI am a God, sprung from the race of Heaven? SILENUS:I told them so, but they bore off your things,And ate the cheese in spite of all I said,And carried out the lambs—and said, moreover,They’d pin you down with a three-cubit collar,And pull your vitals out through your one eye,Furrow your back with stripes, then, binding you,Throw you as ballast into the ship’s hold,And then deliver you, a slave, to moveEnormous rocks, or found a vestibule.CYCLOPS:In truth? Nay, haste, and place in order quicklyThe cooking-knives, and heap upon the hearth,And kindle it, a great faggot of wood.--As soon as they are slaughtered, they shall fillMy belly, broiling warm from the live coals,Or boiled and seethed within the bubbling caldron.I am quite sick of the wild mountain game;Of stags and lions I have gorged enough,And I grow hungry for the flesh of men.SILENUS:Nay, master, something new is very pleasantAfter one thing forever, and of late Very few strangers have approached our cave.ULYSSES:Hear, Cyclops, a plain tale on the other side.We, wanting to buy food, came from our shipInto the neighbourhood of your cave, and hereThis old Silenus gave us in exchange These lambs for wine, the which he took and drank,And all by mutual compact, without force.There is no word of truth in what he says,For slyly he was selling all your store.SILENUS:I? May you perish, wretch--ULYSSES:If I speak false! SILENUS:Cyclops, I swear by Neptune who begot thee,By mighty Triton and by Nereus old,Calypso and the glaucous Ocean Nymphs,The sacred waves and all the race of fishes--Be these the witnesses, my dear sweet master,My darling little Cyclops, that I neverGave any of your stores to these false strangers;--If I speak false may those whom most I love,My children, perish wretchedly!CHORUS:There stop!I saw him giving these things to the strangers.If I speak false, then may my father perish,But do not thou wrong hospitality.CYCLOPS:You lie! I swear that he is juster farThan Rhadamanthus--I trust more in him.But let me ask, whence have ye sailed, O strangers? Who are you? And what city nourished ye?ULYSSES:Our race is Ithacan--having destroyedThe town of Troy, the tempests of the seaHave driven us on thy land, O Polypheme.CYCLOPS:What, have ye shared in the unenvied spoil Of the false Helen, near Scamander’s stream?ULYSSES:The same, having endured a woful toil.CYCLOPS:Oh, basest expedition! sailed ye notFrom Greece to Phrygia for one woman’s sake?ULYSSES:’Twas the Gods’ work—no mortal was in fault. But, O great Offspring of the Ocean-King,We pray thee and admonish thee with freedom,That thou dost spare thy friends who visit thee,And place no impious food within thy jaws.For in the depths of Greece we have upreared Temples to thy great Father, which are allHis homes. The sacred bay of TaenarusRemains inviolate, and each dim recessScooped high on the Malean promontory,And aery Sunium’s silver-veined crag,Which divine Pallas keeps unprofaned ever,The Gerastian asylums, and whate’erWithin wide Greece our enterprise has keptFrom Phrygian contumely; and in whichYou have a common care, for you inhabitThe skirts of Grecian land, under the rootsOf Aetna and its crags, spotted with fire.Turn then to converse under human laws,Receive us shipwrecked suppliants, and provideFood, clothes, and fire, and hospitable gifts; Nor fixing upon oxen-piercing spitsOur limbs, so fill your belly and your jaws.Priam’s wide land has widowed Greece enough;And weapon-winged murder leaped togetherEnough of dead, and wives are husbandless, And ancient women and gray fathers wailTheir childless age;—if you should roast the rest--And ’tis a bitter feast that you prepare--Where then would any turn? Yet be persuaded;Forgo the lust of your jaw-bone; prefer Pious humanity to wicked will:Many have bought too dear their evil joys.SILENUS:Let me advise you, do not spare a morselOf all his flesh. If you should eat his tongueYou would become most eloquent, O Cyclops. CYCLOPS:Wealth, my good fellow, is the wise man’s God,All other things are a pretence and boast.What are my father’s ocean promontories,The sacred rocks whereon he dwells, to me?Stranger, I laugh to scorn Jove’s thunderbolt, I know not that his strength is more than mine.As to the rest I care not.—When he poursRain from above, I have a close pavilionUnder this rock, in which I lie supine,Feasting on a roast calf or some wild beast, And drinking pans of milk, and gloriouslyEmulating the thunder of high Heaven.And when the Thracian wind pours down the snow,I wrap my body in the skins of beasts,Kindle a fire, and bid the snow whirl on. The earth, by force, whether it will or no,Bringing forth grass, fattens my flocks and herds,Which, to what other God but to myselfAnd this great belly, first of deities,Should I be bound to sacrifice? I well know The wise man’s only Jupiter is this,To eat and drink during his little day,And give himself no care. And as for thoseWho complicate with laws the life of man,I freely give them tears for their reward. I will not cheat my soul of its delight,Or hesitate in dining upon you:--And that I may be quit of all demands,These are my hospitable gifts;—fierce fireAnd yon ancestral caldron, which o’er-bubbling Shall finely cook your miserable flesh.Creep in!--...ULYSSES:Ai! ai! I have escaped the Trojan toils,I have escaped the sea, and now I fallUnder the cruel grasp of one impious man. O Pallas, Mistress, Goddess, sprung from Jove,Now, now, assist me! Mightier toils than TroyAre these;—I totter on the chasms of peril;--And thou who inhabitest the thronesOf the bright stars, look, hospitable Jove, Upon this outrage of thy deity,Otherwise be considered as no God!CHORUS (ALONE):For your gaping gulf and your gullet wide,The ravin is ready on every side,The limbs of the strangers are cooked and done;There is boiled meat, and roast meat, and meat from the coal,You may chop it, and tear it, and gnash it for fun,An hairy goat’s-skin contains the whole.Let me but escape, and ferry me o’erThe stream of your wrath to a safer shore.The Cyclops Aetnean is cruel and bold,He murders the strangersThat sit on his hearth,And dreads no avengersTo rise from the earth.He roasts the men before they are cold,He snatches them broiling from the coal,And from the caldron pulls them whole,And minces their flesh and gnaws their boneWith his cursed teeth, till all be gone. Farewell, foul pavilion:Farewell, rites of dread!The Cyclops vermilion,With slaughter uncloying,Now feasts on the dead, In the flesh of strangers joying!ULYSSES:O Jupiter! I saw within the caveHorrible things; deeds to be feigned in words,But not to be believed as being done.CHORUS:What! sawest thou the impious Polypheme Feasting upon your loved companions now?ULYSSES:Selecting two, the plumpest of the crowd,He grasped them in his hands.--CHORUS:Unhappy man!...ULYSSES:Soon as we came into this craggy place,Kindling a fire, he cast on the broad hearth The knotty limbs of an enormous oak,Three waggon-loads at least, and then he strewedUpon the ground, beside the red firelight,His couch of pine-leaves; and he milked the cows,And pouring forth the white milk, filled a bowl Three cubits wide and four in depth, as muchAs would contain ten amphorae, and bound itWith ivy wreaths; then placed upon the fireA brazen pot to boil, and made red hotThe points of spits, not sharpened with the sickle But with a fruit tree bough, and with the jawsOf axes for Aetnean slaughterings.And when this God-abandoned Cook of HellHad made all ready, he seized two of usAnd killed them in a kind of measured manner; For he flung one against the brazen rivetsOf the huge caldron, and seized the otherBy the foot’s tendon, and knocked out his brainsUpon the sharp edge of the craggy stone:Then peeled his flesh with a great cooking-knife And put him down to roast. The other’s limbsHe chopped into the caldron to be boiled.And I, with the tears raining from my eyes,Stood near the Cyclops, ministering to him;The rest, in the recesses of the cave,Clung to the rock like bats, bloodless with fear.When he was filled with my companions’ flesh,He threw himself upon the ground and sentA loathsome exhalation from his maw.Then a divine thought came to me. I filled The cup of Maron, and I offered himTo taste, and said:—‘Child of the Ocean God,Behold what drink the vines of Greece produce,The exultation and the joy of Bacchus.’He, satiated with his unnatural food, Received it, and at one draught drank it off,And taking my hand, praised me:—‘Thou hast givenA sweet draught after a sweet meal, dear guest.’And I, perceiving that it pleased him, filledAnother cup, well knowing that the wine Would wound him soon and take a sure revenge.And the charm fascinated him, and IPlied him cup after cup, until the drinkHad warmed his entrails, and he sang aloudIn concert with my wailing fellow-seamen A hideous discord—and the cavern rung.I have stolen out, so that if you willYou may achieve my safety and your own.But say, do you desire, or not, to flyThis uncompanionable man, and dwellAs was your wont among the Grecian NymphsWithin the fanes of your beloved God?Your father there within agrees to it,But he is weak and overcome with wine,And caught as if with bird-lime by the cup, He claps his wings and crows in doting joy.You who are young escape with me, and findBacchus your ancient friend; unsuited heTo this rude Cyclops.CHORUS:Oh my dearest friend,That I could see that day, and leave for ever The impious Cyclops....ULYSSES:Listen then what a punishment I haveFor this fell monster, how secure a flightFrom your hard servitude.CHORUS:O sweeter farThan is the music of an Asian lyreWould be the news of Polypheme destroyed.ULYSSES:Delighted with the Bacchic drink he goesTo call his brother Cyclops--who inhabitA village upon Aetna not far off.CHORUS:I understand, catching him when aloneYou think by some measure to dispatch him,Or thrust him from the precipice.ULYSSES:Oh no;Nothing of that kind; my device is subtle.CHORUS:How then? I heard of old that thou wert wise.ULYSSES:I will dissuade him from this plan, by saying It were unwise to give the CyclopsesThis precious drink, which if enjoyed aloneWould make life sweeter for a longer time.When, vanquished by the Bacchic power, he sleeps,There is a trunk of olive wood within,Whose point having made sharp with this good swordI will conceal in fire, and when I seeIt is alight, will fix it, burning yet,Within the socket of the Cyclops’ eyeAnd melt it out with fire—as when a man Turns by its handle a great auger round,Fitting the framework of a ship with beams,So will I, in the Cyclops’ fiery eyeTurn round the brand and dry the pupil up.CHORUS:Joy! I am mad with joy at your device.ULYSSES:And then with you, my friends, and the old man,We’ll load the hollow depth of our black ship,And row with double strokes from this dread shore.CHORUS:May I, as in libations to a God,Share in the blinding him with the red brand? I would have some communion in his death.ULYSSES:Doubtless: the brand is a great brand to hold.CHORUS:Oh! I would lift an hundred waggon-loads,If like a wasp’s nest I could scoop the eye outOf the detested Cyclops.ULYSSES:Silence now! Ye know the close device—and when I call,Look ye obey the masters of the craft.I will not save myself and leave behindMy comrades in the cave: I might escape,Having got clear from that obscure recess, But ’twere unjust to leave in jeopardyThe dear companions who sailed here with me.CHORUS:Come! who is first, that with his handWill urge down the burning brandThrough the lids, and quench and pierceThe Cyclops’ eye so fiery fierce?SEMICHORUS 1 [SONG WITHIN]:Listen! listen! he is coming,A most hideous discord humming.Drunken, museless, awkward, yelling,Far along his rocky dwelling; Let us with some comic spellTeach the yet unteachable.By all means he must be blinded,If my counsel be but minded.SEMICHORUS 2:Happy thou made odorous With the dew which sweet grapes weep,To the village hastening thus,Seek the vines that soothe to sleep;Having first embraced thy friend,Thou in luxury without end,With the strings of yellow hair,Of thy voluptuous leman fair,Shalt sit playing on a bed!--Speak! what door is opened?CYCLOPS:Ha! ha! ha! I’m full of wine, Heavy with the joy divine,With the young feast oversated;Like a merchant’s vessel freightedTo the water’s edge, my cropIs laden to the gullet’s top. The fresh meadow grass of springTempts me forth thus wanderingTo my brothers on the mountains,Who shall share the wine’s sweet fountains.Bring the cask, O stranger, bring!CHORUS:One with eyes the fairestCometh from his dwelling;Some one loves thee, rarestBright beyond my telling.In thy grace thou shinest Like some nymph divinestIn her caverns dewy:--All delights pursue thee,Soon pied flowers, sweet-breathing,Shall thy head be wreathing. ULYSSES:Listen, O Cyclops, for I am well skilledIn Bacchus, whom I gave thee of to drink.CYCLOPS:What sort of God is Bacchus then accounted?ULYSSES:The greatest among men for joy of life.CYCLOPS:I gulped him down with very great delight. ULYSSES:This is a God who never injures men.CYCLOPS:How does the God like living in a skin?ULYSSES:He is content wherever he is put.CYCLOPS:Gods should not have their body in a skin.ULYSSES:If he gives joy, what is his skin to you? CYCLOPS:I hate the skin, but love the wine within.ULYSSES:Stay here now: drink, and make your spirit glad.CYCLOPS:Should I not share this liquor with my brothers?ULYSSES:Keep it yourself, and be more honoured so.CYCLOPS:I were more useful, giving to my friends. ULYSSES:But village mirth breeds contests, broils, and blows.CYCLOPS:When I am drunk none shall lay hands on me.--ULYSSES:A drunken man is better within doors.CYCLOPS:He is a fool, who drinking, loves not mirth.ULYSSES:But he is wise, who drunk, remains at home.CYCLOPS:What shall I do, Silenus? Shall I stay?SILENUS:Stay—for what need have you of pot companions?CYCLOPS:Indeed this place is closely carpetedWith flowers and grass.SILENUS:And in the sun-warm noon’Tis sweet to drink. Lie down beside me now, Placing your mighty sides upon the ground.CYCLOPS:What do you put the cup behind me for?SILENUS:That no one here may touch it.CYCLOPS:Thievish One!You want to drink;--here place it in the midst.And thou, O stranger, tell how art thou called? ULYSSES:My name is Nobody. What favour nowShall I receive to praise you at your hands?CYCLOPS:I’ll feast on you the last of your companions.ULYSSES:You grant your guest a fair reward, O Cyclops.CYCLOPS:Ha! what is this? Stealing the wine, you rogue! SILENUS:It was this stranger kissing me becauseI looked so beautiful.CYCLOPS:You shall repentFor kissing the coy wine that loves you not.SILENUS:By Jupiter! you said that I am fair.CYCLOPS:Pour out, and only give me the cup full. SILENUS:How is it mixed? let me observe.CYCLOPS:Curse you!Give it me so.SILENUS:Not till I see you wearThat coronal, and taste the cup to you.CYCLOPS:Thou wily traitor!SILENUS:But the wine is sweet.Ay, you will roar if you are caught in drinking. CYCLOPS:See now, my lip is clean and all my beard.SILENUS:Now put your elbow right and drink again.As you see me drink--...CYCLOPS:How now?SILENUS:Ye Gods, what a delicious gulp!CYCLOPS:Guest, take it;--you pour out the wine for me.ULYSSES:The wine is well accustomed to my hand.CYCLOPS:Pour out the wine!ULYSSES:I pour; only be silent.CYCLOPS:Silence is a hard task to him who drinks.ULYSSES:Take it and drink it off; leave not a dreg.Oh that the drinker died with his own draught!CYCLOPS:Papai! the vine must be a sapient plant.ULYSSES:If you drink much after a mighty feast,Moistening your thirsty maw, you will sleep well;If you leave aught, Bacchus will dry you up.CYCLOPS:Ho! ho! I can scarce rise. What pure delight!The heavens and earth appear to whirl aboutConfusedly. I see the throne of JoveAnd the clear congregation of the Gods.Now if the Graces tempted me to kissI would not—for the loveliest of them all I would not leave this Ganymede.SILENUS:Polypheme,I am the Ganymede of Jupiter.CYCLOPS:By Jove, you are; I bore you off from Dardanus....[ULYSSES AND THE CHORUS.]ULYSSES:Come, boys of Bacchus, children of high race,This man within is folded up in sleep, And soon will vomit flesh from his fell maw;The brand under the shed thrusts out its smoke,No preparation needs, but to burn outThe monster’s eye;—but bear yourselves like men.CHORUS:We will have courage like the adamant rock,All things are ready for you here; go in,Before our father shall perceive the noise.ULYSSES:Vulcan, Aetnean king! burn out with fireThe shining eye of this thy neighbouring monster!And thou, O Sleep, nursling of gloomy Night,Descend unmixed on this God-hated beast,And suffer not Ulysses and his comrades,Returning from their famous Trojan toils,To perish by this man, who cares not eitherFor God or mortal; or I needs must think That Chance is a supreme divinity,And things divine are subject to her power.CHORUS:Soon a crab the throat will seizeOf him who feeds upon his guest,Fire will burn his lamp-like eyes In revenge of such a feast!A great oak stump now is lyingIn the ashes yet undying.Come, Maron, come!Raging let him fix the doom, Let him tear the eyelid upOf the Cyclops—that his cupMay be evil!Oh! I long to dance and revelWith sweet Bromian, long desired,In loved ivy wreaths attired;Leaving this abandoned home--Will the moment ever come?ULYSSES:Be silent, ye wild things! Nay, hold your peace,And keep your lips quite close; dare not to breathe, Or spit, or e’en wink, lest ye wake the monster,Until his eye be tortured out with fire.CHORUS:Nay, we are silent, and we chaw the air.ULYSSES:Come now, and lend a hand to the great stakeWithin—it is delightfully red hot. CHORUS:You then command who first should seize the stakeTo burn the Cyclops’ eye, that all may shareIn the great enterprise.SEMICHORUS 1:We are too far;We cannot at this distance from the doorThrust fire into his eye.SEMICHORUS 2:And we just now Have become lame! cannot move hand or foot.CHORUS:The same thing has occurred to us,--our anklesAre sprained with standing here, I know not how.ULYSSES:What, sprained with standing still?CHORUS:And there is dustOr ashes in our eyes, I know not whence.ULYSSES:Cowardly dogs! ye will not aid me then?CHORUS:With pitying my own back and my back-bone,And with not wishing all my teeth knocked out,This cowardice comes of itself—but stay,I know a famous Orphic incantationTo make the brand stick of its own accordInto the skull of this one-eyed son of Earth.ULYSSES:Of old I knew ye thus by nature; nowI know ye better.—I will use the aidOf my own comrades. Yet though weak of hand Speak cheerfully, that so ye may awakenThe courage of my friends with your blithe words.CHORUS:This I will do with peril of my life,And blind you with my exhortations, Cyclops.Hasten and thrust, And parch up to dust,The eye of the beastWho feeds on his guest.Burn and blindThe Aetnean hind!Scoop and draw,But beware lest he clawYour limbs near his maw.CYCLOPS:Ah me! my eyesight is parched up to cinders.CHORUS:What a sweet paean! sing me that again!CYCLOPS:Ah me! indeed, what woe has fallen upon me!But, wretched nothings, think ye not to fleeOut of this rock; I, standing at the outlet,Will bar the way and catch you as you pass.CHORUS:What are you roaring out, Cyclops?CYCLOPS:I perish! CHORUS:For you are wicked.CYCLOPS:And besides miserable.CHORUS:What, did you fall into the fire when drunk?CYCLOPS:’Twas Nobody destroyed me.CHORUS:Why then no oneCan be to blame.CYCLOPS:I say ’twas NobodyWho blinded me.CHORUS:Why then you are not blind. CYCLOPS:I wish you were as blind as I am.CHORUS:Nay,It cannot be that no one made you blind.CYCLOPS:You jeer me; where, I ask, is Nobody?CHORUS:Nowhere, O Cyclops.CYCLOPS:It was that stranger ruined me:--the wretchFirst gave me wine and then burned out my eye,For wine is strong and hard to struggle with.Have they escaped, or are they yet within?CHORUS:They stand under the darkness of the rockAnd cling to it.CYCLOPS:At my right hand or left?CHORUS:Close on your right.CYCLOPS:Where?CHORUS:Near the rock itself.You have them.CYCLOPS:Oh, misfortune on misfortune!I’ve cracked my skull.CHORUS:Now they escape you--there.CYCLOPS:Not there, although you say so.CHORUS:Not on that side.CYCLOPS:Where then?CHORUS:They creep about you on your left.

The Drowned Lover,"                        I.Ah! faint are her limbs, and her footstep is weary,Yet far must the desolate wanderer roam;Though the tempest is stern, and the mountain is dreary,She must quit at deep midnight her pitiless home.I see her swift foot dash the dew from the whortle,As she rapidly hastes to the green grove of myrtle;And I hear, as she wraps round her figure the kirtle,'Stay thy boat on the lake,--dearest Henry, I come.'II.High swelled in her bosom the throb of affection,As lightly her form bounded over the lea, And arose in her mind every dear recollection;'I come, dearest Henry, and wait but for thee.'How sad, when dear hope every sorrow is soothing,When sympathy's swell the soft bosom is moving,And the mind the mild joys of affection is proving,Is the stern voice of fate that bids happiness flee!III.Oh! dark lowered the clouds on that horrible eve,And the moon dimly gleamed through the tempested air;Oh! how could fond visions such softness deceive?Oh! how could false hope rend, a bosom so fair? Thy love's pallid corse the wild surges are laving,O'er his form the fierce swell of the tempest is raving;But, fear not, parting spirit; thy goodness is saving,In eternity's bowers, a seat for thee there.

The Devil's Walk.  A Ballad,"                        I.Once, early in the morning, Beelzebub arose,With care his sweet person adorning,He put on his Sunday clothes.II.He drew on a boot to hide his hoof, He drew on a glove to hide his claw,His horns were concealed by a Bras Chapeau,And the Devil went forth as natty a BeauAs Bond-street ever saw.III.He sate him down, in London town, Before earth's morning ray;With a favourite imp he began to chat,On religion, and scandal, this and that,Until the dawn of day.IV.And then to St. James's Court he went, And St. Paul’s Church he took on his way;He was mighty thick with every Saint,Though they were formal and he was gay.V.The Devil was an agriculturist,And as bad weeds quickly grow, In looking over his farm, I wist,He wouldn't find cause for woe.VI.He peeped in each hole, to each chamber stole,His promising live-stock to view;Grinning applause, he just showed them his claws, And they shrunk with affright from his ugly sight,Whose work they delighted to do.VII.Satan poked his red nose into crannies so smallOne would think that the innocents fair,Poor lambkins! were just doing nothing at all But settling some dress or arranging some ball,But the Devil saw deeper there.VIII.A Priest, at whose elbow the Devil during prayerSate familiarly, side by side,Declared that, if the Tempter were there, His presence he would not abide.Ah! ah! thought Old Nick, that's a very stale trick,For without the Devil, O favourite of Evil,In your carriage you would not ride.IX.Satan next saw a brainless King,Whose house was as hot as his own;Many Imps in attendance were there on the wing,They flapped the pennon and twisted the sting,Close by the very Throne.X.Ah! ah! thought Satan, the pasture is good,My Cattle will here thrive better than others;They dine on news of human blood,They sup on the groans of the dying and dead,And supperless never will go to bed;Which will make them fat as their brothers. XI.Fat as the Fiends that feed on blood,Fresh and warm from the fields of Spain,Where Ruin ploughs her gory way,Where the shoots of earth are nipped in the bud,Where Hell is the Victor's prey, Its glory the meed of the slain.XII.Fat--as the Death-birds on Erin's shore,That glutted themselves in her dearest gore,And flitted round Castlereagh,When they snatched the Patriot's heart, that HIS grasp Had torn from its widow's maniac clasp,--And fled at the dawn of day.XIII.Fat--as the Reptiles of the tomb,That riot in corruption's spoil,That fret their little hour in gloom, And creep, and live the while.XIV.Fat as that Prince's maudlin brain,Which, addled by some gilded toy,Tired, gives his sweetmeat, and againCries for it, like a humoured boy. XV.For he is fat,--his waistcoat gay,When strained upon a levee day,Scarce meets across his princely paunch;And pantaloons are like half-moonsUpon each brawny haunch. XVI.How vast his stock of calf! when plentyHad filled his empty head and heart,Enough to satiate foplings twenty,Could make his pantaloon seams start.XVII.The Devil (who sometimes is called Nature), For men of power provides thus well,Whilst every change and every feature,Their great original can tell.XVIII.Satan saw a lawyer a viper slay,That crawled up the leg of his table,It reminded him most marvellouslyOf the story of Cain and Abel.IXX.The wealthy yeoman, as he wandersHis fertile fields among,And on his thriving cattle ponders,Counts his sure gains, and hums a song;Thus did the Devil, through earth walking,Hum low a hellish song.XX.For they thrive well whose garb of goreIs Satan’s choicest livery, And they thrive well who from the poorHave snatched the bread of penury,And heap the houseless wanderer’s storeOn the rank pile of luxury.XXI.The Bishops thrive, though they are big; The Lawyers thrive, though they are thin;For every gown, and every wig,Hides the safe thrift of Hell within.XXII.Thus pigs were never counted clean,Although they dine on finest corn; And cormorants are sin-like lean,Although they eat from night to morn.XXIII.Oh! why is the Father of Hell in such glee,As he grins from ear to ear?Why does he doff his clothes joyfully,As he skips, and prances, and flaps his wing,As he sidles, leers, and twirls his sting,And dares, as he is, to appear?XXIV.A statesman passed--alone to him,The Devil dare his whole shape uncover, To show each feature, every limb,Secure of an unchanging lover.XXV.At this known sign, a welcome sight,The watchful demons sought their King,And every Fiend of the Stygian night, Was in an instant on the wing.XXVI.Pale Loyalty, his guilt-steeled brow,With wreaths of gory laurel crowned:The hell-hounds, Murder, Want and Woe,Forever hungering, flocked around; From Spain had Satan sought their food,'Twas human woe and human blood!XXVII.Hark! the earthquake's crash I hear,--Kings turn pale, and Conquerors start,Ruffians tremble in their fear,For their Satan doth depart.XXVIII.This day Fiends give to revelryTo celebrate their King's return,And with delight its Sire to seeHell's adamantine limits burn. XXIX.But were the Devil's sight as keenAs Reason's penetrating eye,His sulphurous Majesty I ween,Would find but little cause for joy.XXX.For the sons of Reason see That, ere fate consume the Pole,The false Tyrant's cheek shall beBloodless as his coward soul.

Song.

Song. Sorrow,"                        To me this world's a dreary blank,All hopes in life are gone and fled,My high strung energies are sank,And all my blissful hopes lie dead.--The world once smiling to my view, Showed scenes of endless bliss and joy;The world I then but little knew,Ah! little knew how pleasures cloy;All then was jocund, all was gay,No thought beyond the present hour,I danced in pleasure’s fading ray,Fading alas! as drooping flower.Nor do the heedless in the throng,One thought beyond the morrow give,They court the feast, the dance, the song, Nor think how short their time to live.The heart that bears deep sorrow’s trace,What earthly comfort can console,It drags a dull and lengthened pace,'Till friendly death its woes enroll.--The sunken cheek, the humid eyes,E’en better than the tongue can tell;In whose sad breast deep sorrow lies,Where memory's rankling traces dwell.--The rising tear, the stifled sigh, A mind but ill at ease display,Like blackening clouds in stormy sky,Where fiercely vivid lightnings play.Thus when souls' energy is dead,When sorrow dims each earthly view, When every fairy hope is fled,We bid ungrateful world adieu.AUGUST, 1810.

The Cenci : A Tragedy In Five Acts,"                        DRAMATIS PERSONÆCount Francesco Cenci.Giacomo, his Son.Bernardo, his Son.Cardinal Camillo.Orsino, a Prelate.Savella, the Pope's Legate.Olimpio, Assassin.Marzio, Assassin.Andrea, Servant to Cenci.Nobles, Judges, Guards, Servants.Lucretia, Wife of Cenci, and Step-mother of his children.Beatrice, his Daughter.The Scene lies principally in Rome, but changes during the Fourth Act to Petrella, a castle among the Apulian Apennines.Time. During the Pontificate of Clement VIII.ACT IScene I.-An Apartment in the Cenci Palace.Enter Count Cenci, and Cardinal Camillo.Camillo.That matter of the murder is hushed upIf you consent to yield his HolinessYour fief that lies beyond the Pincian gate.-It needed all my interest in the conclaveTo bend him to this point: he said that youBought perilous impunity with your gold;That crimes like yours if once or twice compoundedEnriched the Church, and respited from hellAn erring soul which might repent and live:-But that the glory and the interestOf the high throne he fills, little consistWith making it a daily mart of guiltAs manifold and hideous as the deedsWhich you scarce hide from men's revolted eyes.Cenci.The third of my possessions-let it go!Ay, I once heard the nephew of the PopeHad sent his architect to view the ground,Meaning to build a villa on my vinesThe next time I compounded with his uncle:I little thought he should outwit me so!Henceforth no witness-not the lamp-shall seeThat which the vassal threatened to divulgeWhose throat is choked with dust for his reward.The deed he saw could not have rated higherThan his most worthless life:-it angers me!Respited me from Hell!-So may the DevilRespite their souls from Heaven. No doubt Pope Clement,And his most charitable nephews, prayThat the Apostle Peter and the SaintsWill grant for their sake that I long enjoyStrength, wealth, and pride, and lust, and length of daysWherein to act the deeds which are the stewardsOf their revenue.-But much yet remainsTo which they show no title.Camillo.Oh, Count Cenci!So much that thou mightst honourably liveAnd reconcile thyself with thine own heartAnd with thy God, and with the offended world.How hideously look deeds of lust and bloodThrough those snow white and venerable hairs!-Your children should be sitting round you now,But that you fear to read upon their looksThe shame and misery you have written there.Where is your wife? Where is your gentle daughter?Methinks her sweet looks, which make all things elseBeauteous and glad, might kill the fiend within you.Why is she barred from all societyBut her own strange and uncomplaining wrongs?Talk with me, Count,-you know I mean you wellI stood beside your dark and fiery youthWatching its bold and bad career, as menWatch meteors, but it vanished not-I markedYour desperate and remorseless manhood; nowDo I behold you in dishonoured ageCharged with a thousand unrepented crimes.Yet I have ever hoped you would amend,And in that hope have saved your life three times.Cenci.For which Aldobrandino owes you nowMy fief beyond the Pincian.-Cardinal,One thing, I pray you, recollect henceforth,And so we shall converse with less restraint.A man you knew spoke of my wife and daughter-He was accustomed to frequent my house;So the next day his wife and daughter cameAnd asked if I had seen him; and I smiled:I think they never saw him any more.Camillo.Thou execrable man, beware!-Cenci.Of thee?Nay this is idle:-We should know each other.As to my character for what men call crimeSeeing I please my senses as I list,And vindicate that right with force or guile,It is a public matter, and I care notIf I discuss it with you. I may speakAlike to you and my own conscious heart-For you give out that you have half reformed me,Therefore strong vanity will keep you silentIf fear should not; both will, I do not doubt.All men delight in sensual luxury,All men enjoy revenge; and most exultOver the tortures they can never feel-Flattering their secret peace with others' pain.But I delight in nothing else. I loveThe sight of agony, and the sense of joy,When this shall be another's, and that mine.And I have no remorse and little fear,Which are, I think, the checks of other men.This mood has grown upon me, until nowAny design my captious fancy makesThe picture of its wish, and it forms noneBut such as men like you would start to know,Is as my natural food and rest debarredUntil it be accomplished.Camillo.Art thou notMost miserable?Cenci.Why, miserable?-No.-I am what your theologians callHardened;-which they must be in impudence,So to revile a man's peculiar taste.True, I was happier than I am, while yetManhood remained to act the thing I thought;While lust was sweeter than revenge; and nowInvention palls:-Ay, we must all grow old-And but that there yet remains a deed to actWhose horror might make sharp an appetiteDuller than mine-I'd do-I know not what.When I was young I thought of nothing elseBut pleasure; and I fed on honey sweets:Men, by St. Thomas! cannot live like bees,And I grew tired:-yet, till I killed a foe,And heard his groans, and heard his children's groans,Knew I not what delight was else on earth,Which now delights me little. I the ratherLook on such pangs as terror ill conceals,The dry fixed eyeball; the pale quivering lip,Which tell me that the spirit weeps withinTears bitterer than the bloody sweat of Christ.I rarely kill the body, which preserves,Like a strong prison, the soul within my power,Wherein I feed it with the breath of fearFor hourly pain.Camillo.Hell's most abandoned fiendDid never, in the drunkenness of guilt,Speak to his heart as now you speak to me;I thank my God that I believe you not.Enter Andrea.Andrea.My Lord, a gentleman from SalamancaWould speak with you.Cenci.Bid him attend me inThe grand saloon.[Exit Andrea.Camillo.Farewell; and I will prayAlmighty God that thy false, impious wordsTempt not his spirit to abandon thee.[Exit Camillo.Cenci.The third of my possessions! I must useClose husbandry, or gold, the old man's sword,Falls from my withered hand. But yesterdayThere came an order from the Pope to makeFourfold provision for my cursèd sons;Whom I had sent from Rome to Salamanca,Hoping some accident might cut them off;And meaning if I could to starve them there.I pray thee, God, send some quick death upon them!Bernardo and my wife could not be worseIf dead and damned:-then, as to Beatrice- [Looking around him suspiciously.I think they cannot hear me at that door;What if they should? And yet I need not speakThough the heart triumphs with itself in words.O, thou most silent air, that shalt not hearWhat now I think! Thou, pavement, which I treadTowards her chamber,-let your echoes talkOf my imperious step scorning surprise,But not of my intent!-Andrea![Enter Andrea.Andrea.My lord?Cenci.Bid Beatrice attend me in her chamberThis evening:-no, at midnight and alone.[Exeunt.Scene II.-A Garden of the Cenci Palace. EnterBeatrice and Orsino, as in conversation.Beatrice.Pervert not truth,Orsino. You remember where we heldThat conversation;-nay, we see the spotEven from this cypress;-two long years are pastSince, on an April midnight, underneathThe moonlight ruins of mount Palatine,I did confess to you my secret mind.Orsino.You said you loved me then.Beatrice.You are a Priest,Speak to me not of love.Orsino.I may obtainThe dispensation of the Pope to marry.Because I am a Priest do you believeYour image, as the hunter some struck deer,Follows me not whether I wake or sleep?Beatrice.As I have said, speak to me not of love;Had you a dispensation I have not;Nor will I leave this home of miseryWhilst my poor Bernard, and that gentle ladyTo whom I owe life, and these virtuous thoughts,Must suffer what I still have strength to share.Alas, Orsino! All the love that onceI felt for you, is turned to bitter pain.Ours was a youthful contract, which you firstBroke, by assuming vows no Pope will loose.And thus I love you still, but holily,Even as a sister or a spirit might;And so I swear a cold fidelity.And it is well perhaps we shall not marry.You have a sly, equivocating veinThat suits me not.-Ah, wretched that I am!Where shall I turn? Even now you look on meAs you were not my friend, and as if youDiscovered that I thought so, with false smilesMaking my true suspicion seem your wrong.Ah, no! forgive me; sorrow makes me seemSterner than else my nature might have been;I have a weight of melancholy thoughts,And they forbode,-but what can they forbodeWorse than I now endure?Orsino.All will be well.Is the petition yet prepared? You knowMy zeal for all you wish, sweet Beatrice;Doubt not but I will use my utmost skillSo that the Pope attend to your complaint.Beatrice.Your zeal for all I wish;-Ah me, you are cold!Your utmost skill . . . speak but one word . . . (aside)Alas!Weak and deserted creature that I am,Here I stand bickering with my only friend! [To Orsino.This night my father gives a sumptuous feast,Orsino; he has heard some happy newsFrom Salamanca, from my brothers there,And with this outward show of love he mocksHis inward hate. 'Tis bold hypocrisy,For he would gladlier celebrate their deaths,Which I have heard him pray for on his knees:Great God! that such a father should be mine!But there is mighty preparation made,And all our kin, the Cenci, will be there,And all the chief nobility of Rome.And he has bidden me and my pale MotherAttire ourselves in festival array.Poor lady! She expects some happy changeIn his dark spirit from this act; I none.At supper I will give you the petition:Till when-farewell.Orsino.Farewell. (Exit Beatrice.)I know the PopeWill ne'er absolve me from my priestly vowBut by absolving me from the revenueOf many a wealthy see; and, Beatrice,I think to win thee at an easier rate.Nor shall he read her eloquent petition:He might bestow her on some poor relationOf his sixth cousin, as he did her sister,And I should be debarred from all access.Then as to what she suffers from her father,In all this there is much exaggeration:-Old men are testy and will have their way;A man may stab his enemy, or his vassal,And live a free life as to wine or women,And with a peevish temper may returnTo a dull home, and rate his wife and children;Daughters and wives call this foul tyranny.I shall be well content if on my conscienceThere rest no heavier sin than what they sufferFrom the devices of my love-a netFrom which she shall escape not. Yet I fearHer subtle mind, her awe-inspiring gaze,Whose beams anatomize me nerve by nerveAnd lay me bare, and make me blush to seeMy hidden thoughts.-Ah, no! A friendless girlWho clings to me, as to her only hope:-I were a fool, not less than if a pantherWere panic-stricken by the antelope's eye,If she escape me.[Exit.Scene III.-A Magnificent Hall in the Cenci Palace. A Banquet. Enter Cenci, Lucretia, Beatrice, Orsino, Camillo, Nobles.Cenci.Welcome, my friends and kinsmen; welcome ye,Princes and Cardinals, pillars of the church,Whose presence honours our festivity.I have too long lived like an anchorite,And in my absence from your merry meetingsAn evil word is gone abroad of me;But I do hope that you, my noble friends,When you have shared the entertainment here,And heard the pious cause for which 'tis given,And we have pledged a health or two together,Will think me flesh and blood as well as you;Sinful indeed, for Adam made all so,But tender-hearted, meek and pitiful.First Guest.In truth, my Lord, you seem too light of heart,Too sprightly and companionable a man,To act the deeds that rumour pins on you. (To his Companion.)I never saw such blithe and open cheerIn any eye!Second Guest.Some most desired event,In which we all demand a common joy,Has brought us hither; let us hear it, Count.Cenci.It is indeed a most desired event.If, when a parent from a parent's heartLifts from this earth to the great Father of allA prayer, both when he lays him down to sleep,And when he rises up from dreaming it;One supplication, one desire, one hope,That he would grant a wish for his two sons,Even all that he demands in their regard-And suddenly beyond his dearest hopeIt is accomplished, he should then rejoice,And call his friends and kinsmen to a feast,And task their love to grace his merriment,-Then honour me thus far-for I am he.Beatrice(to Lucretia).Great God! How horrible! Some dreadful illMust have befallen my brothers.Lucretia.Fear not, Child,He speaks too frankly.Beatrice.Ah! My blood runs cold.I fear that wicked laughter round his eye,Which wrinkles up the skin even to the hair.Cenci.Here are the letters brought from Salamanca;Beatrice, read them to your mother. God!I thank thee! In one night didst thou perform,By ways inscrutable, the thing I sought.My disobedient and rebellious sonsAre dead!-Why, dead!-What means this change of cheer?You hear me not, I tell you they are dead;And they will need no food or raiment more:The tapers that did light them the dark wayAre their last cost. The Pope, I think, will notExpect I should maintain them in their coffins.Rejoice with me-my heart is wondrous glad.[Lucretia sinks, half fainting; Beatrice supports her.Beatrice.It is not true!-Dear lady, pray look up.Had it been true, there is a God in Heaven,He would not live to boast of such a boon.Unnatural man, thou knowest that it is false.Cenci.Ay, as the word of God; whom here I callTo witness that I speak the sober truth;-And whose most favouring Providence was shownEven in the manner of their deaths. For RoccoWas kneeling at the mass, with sixteen others,When the church fell and crushed him to a mummy,The rest escaped unhurt. CristofanoWas stabbed in error by a jealous man,Whilst she he loved was sleeping with his rival;All in the self-same hour of the same night;Which shows that Heaven has special care of me.I beg those friends who love me, that they markThe day a feast upon their calendars.It was the twenty-seventh of December:Ay, read the letters if you doubt my oath.[The Assembly appears confused; several of the guests rise.First Guest.Oh, horrible! I will depart-Second Guest.And I.-Third Guest.No, stay!I do believe it is some jest; though faith!'Tis mocking us somewhat too solemnly.I think his son has married the Infanta,Or found a mine of gold in El Dorado;'Tis but to season some such news; stay, stay!I see 'tis only raillery by his smile.Cenci(filling a bowl of wine, and lifting it up).Oh, thou bright wine whose purple splendour leapsAnd bubbles gaily in this golden bowlUnder the lamplight, as my spirits do,To hear the death of my accursèd sons!Could I believe thou wert their mingled blood,Then would I taste thee like a sacrament,And pledge with thee the mighty Devil in Hell,Who, if a father's curses, as men say,Climb with swift wings after their children's souls,And drag them from the very throne of Heaven,Now triumphs in my triumph!-But thou artSuperfluous; I have drunken deep of joy,And I will taste no other wine to-night.Here, Andrea! Bear the bowl around.A Guest(rising).Thou wretch!Will none among this noble companyCheck the abandoned villain?Camillo.For God's sakeLet me dismiss the guests! You are insane,Some ill will come of this.Second Guest.Seize, silence him!First Guest.I will!Third Guest.And I!Cenci(addressing those who rise with a threatening gesture).Who moves? Who speaks?(turning to the Company)'tis nothing Enjoy yourselves.-Beware! For my revengeIs as the sealed commission of a kingThat kills, and none dare name the murderer.[The Banquet is broken up; several of the Guests are departing.Beatrice.I do entreat you, go not, noble guests;What, although tyranny and impious hateStand sheltered by a father's hoary hair?What, if 'tis he who clothed us in these limbsWho tortures them, and triumphs? What, if we,The desolate and the dead, were his own flesh,His children and his wife, whom he is boundTo love and shelter? Shall we therefore findNo refuge in this merciless wide world?O think what deep wrongs must have blotted outFirst love, then reverence in a child's prone mind,Till it thus vanquish shame and fear! O think!I have borne much, and kissed the sacred handWhich crushed us to the earth, and thought its strokeWas perhaps some paternal chastisement!Have excused much, doubted; and when no doubtRemained, have sought by patience, love, and tearsTo soften him, and when this could not beI have knelt down through the long sleepless nightsAnd lifted up to God, the Father of all,Passionate prayers: and when these were not heardI have still borne,-until I meet you here,Princes and kinsmen, at this hideous feastGiven at my brothers' deaths. Two yet remain,His wife remains and I, whom if ye save not,Ye may soon share such merriment againAs fathers make over their children's graves.O Prince Colonna, thou art our near kinsman,Cardinal, thou art the Pope's chamberlain,Camillo, thou art chief justiciary,Take us away!Cenci.(He has been conversing with Camillo during the first part of Beatrice's speech; he hears the conclusion, and now advances.)I hope my good friends hereWill think of their own daughters-or perhapsOf their own throats-before they lend an earTo this wild girl.Beatrice(not noticing the words of Cenci).Dare no one look on me?None answer? Can one tyrant overbearThe sense of many best and wisest men?Or is it that I sue not in some formOf scrupulous law, that ye deny my suit?O God! That I were buried with my brothers!And that the flowers of this departed springWere fading on my grave! And that my fatherWere celebrating now one feast for all!Camillo.A bitter wish for one so young and gentle;Can we do nothing?Colonna.Nothing that I see.Count Cenci were a dangerous enemy:Yet I would second any one.A Cardinal.And I.Cenci.Retire to your chamber, insolent girl!Beatrice.Retire thou, impious man! Ay, hide thyselfWhere never eye can look upon thee more!Wouldst thou have honour and obedienceWho art a torturer? Father, never dreamThough thou mayst overbear this company,But ill must come of ill.-Frown not on me!Haste, hide thyself, lest with avenging looksMy brothers' ghosts should hunt thee from thy seat!Cover thy face from every living eye,And start if thou but hear a human step:Seek out some dark and silent corner, there,Bow thy white head before offended God,And we will kneel around, and ferventlyPray that he pity both ourselves and thee.Cenci.My friends, I do lament this insane girlHas spoilt the mirth of our festivity.Good night, farewell; I will not make you longerSpectators of our dull domestic quarrels.Another time.-[Exeunt all but Cenci and Beatrice.My brain is swimming round;Give me a bowl of wine![To Beatrice.Thou painted viper!Beast that thou art! Fair and yet terrible!I know a charm shall make thee meek and tame,Now get thee from my sight![Exit Beatrice.Here, Andrea,Fill up this goblet with Greek wine. I saidI would not drink this evening; but I must;For, strange to say, I feel my spirits failWith thinking what I have decreed to do.- [Drinking the wine.Be thou the resolution of quick youthWithin my veins, and manhood's purpose stern,And age's firm, cold, subtle villainy;As if thou wert indeed my children's bloodWhich I did thirst to drink! The charm works well;It must be done; it shall be done, I swear![Exit.END OF THE FIRST ACT.ACT IIScene I.-An Apartment in the Cenci Palace. Enter Lucretia and Bernardo.Lucretia.Weep not, my gentle boy; he struck but meWho have borne deeper wrongs. In truth, if heHad killed me, he had done a kinder deed.O God, Almighty, do Thou look upon us,We have no other friend but only Thee!Yet weep not; though I love you as my own,I am not your true mother.Bernardo.O more, more,Than ever mother was to any child,That have you been to me! Had he not beenMy father, do you think that I should weep!Lucretia.Alas! Poor boy, what else couldst thou have done?Enter Beatrice.Beatrice(in a hurried voice).Did he pass this way? Have you seen him, brother?Ah, no! that is his step upon the stairs;'Tis nearer now; his hand is on the door;Mother, if I to thee have ever beenA duteous child, now save me! Thou, great God,Whose image upon earth a father is,Dost Thou indeed abandon me? He comes;The door is opening now; I see his face;He frowns on others, but he smiles on me,Even as he did after the feast last night. Enter a Servant.Almighty God, how merciful Thou art!'Tis but Orsino's servant.-Well, what news?Servant.My master bids me say, the Holy FatherHas sent back your petition thus unopened. [Giving a paper.And he demands at what hour 'twere secureTo visit you again?Lucretia.At the Ave Mary.[Exit Servant.So, daughter, our last hope has failed; Ah me!How pale you look; you tremble, and you standWrapped in some fixed and fearful meditation,As if one thought were over strong for you:Your eyes have a chill glare; O, dearest child!Are you gone mad? If not, pray speak to me.Beatrice.You see I am not mad: I speak to you.Lucretia.You talked of something that your father didAfter that dreadful feast? Could it be worseThan when he smiled, and cried, 'My sons are dead!'And every one looked in his neighbour's faceTo see if others were as white as he?At the first word he spoke I felt the bloodRush to my heart, and fell into a trance;And when it passed I sat all weak and wild;Whilst you alone stood up, and with strong wordsChecked his unnatural pride; and I could seeThe devil was rebuked that lives in him.Until this hour thus have you ever stoodBetween us and your father's moody wrathLike a protecting presence: your firm mindHas been our only refuge and defence:What can have thus subdued it? What can nowHave given you that cold melancholy look,Succeeding to your unaccustomed fear?Beatrice.What is it that you say? I was just thinking'Twere better not to struggle any more.Men, like my father, have been dark and bloody,Yet never-Oh! Before worse comes of it'Twere wise to die: it ends in that at last.Lucretia.Oh, talk not so, dear child! Tell me at onceWhat did your father do or say to you?He stayed not after that accursèd feastOne moment in your chamber.-Speak to me.Bernardo.Oh, sister, sister, prithee, speak to us!Beatrice(speaking very slowly with a forced calmness).It was one word, Mother, one little word;One look, one smile. (Wildly.)Oh! He has trampled meUnder his feet, and made the blood stream downMy pallid cheeks. And he has given us allDitch-water, and the fever-stricken fleshOf buffaloes, and bade us eat or starve,And we have eaten.-He has made me lookOn my beloved Bernardo, when the rustOf heavy chains has gangrened his sweet limbs,And I have never yet despaired-but now!What could I say?[Recovering herself.Ah, no! 'tis nothing new.The sufferings we all share have made me wild:He only struck and cursed me as he passed;He said, he looked, he did;-nothing at allBeyond his wont, yet it disordered me.Alas! I am forgetful of my duty,I should preserve my senses for your sake.Lucretia.Nay, Beatrice; have courage, my sweet girl,If any one despairs it should be IWho loved him once, and now must live with himTill God in pity call for him or me.For you may, like your sister, find some husband,And smile, years hence, with children round your knees;Whilst I, then dead, and all this hideous coilShall be remembered only as a dream.Beatrice.Talk not to me, dear lady, of a husband.Did you not nurse me when my mother died?Did you not shield me and that dearest boy?And had we any other friend but youIn infancy, with gentle words and looks,To win our father not to murder us?And shall I now desert you? May the ghostOf my dead Mother plead against my soulIf I abandon her who filled the placeShe left, with more, even, than a mother's love!Bernardo.And I am of my sister's mind. IndeedI would not leave you in this wretchedness,Even though the Pope should make me free to liveIn some blithe place, like others of my age,With sports, and delicate food, and the fresh air.Oh, never think that I will leave you, Mother!Lucretia.My dear, dear children!Enter Cenci, suddenly.Cenci.What, Beatrice here!Come hither![She shrinks back, and covers her face.Nay, hide not your face, 'tis fair;Look up! Why, yesternight you dared to lookWith disobedient insolence upon me,Bending a stern and an inquiring browOn what I meant; whilst I then sought to hideThat which I came to tell you-but in vain.Beatrice(wildly, staggering towards the door).O that the earth would gape! Hide me, O God!Cenci.Then it was I whose inarticulate wordsFell from my lips, and who with tottering stepsFled from your presence, as you now from mine.Stay, I command you-from this day and hourNever again, I think, with fearless eye,And brow superior, and unaltered cheek,And that lip made for tenderness or scorn,Shalt thou strike dumb the meanest of mankind;Me least of all. Now get thee to thy chamber!Thou too, loathed image of thy cursèd mother, [To Bernardo.Thy milky, meek face makes me sick with hate! [Exeunt Beatrice and Bernardo.(Aside.)So much has passed between us as must makeMe bold, her fearful.-'Tis an awful thingTo touch such mischief as I now conceive:So men sit shivering on the dewy bank,And try the chill stream with their feet; once in . . .How the delighted spirit pants for joy!Lucretia(advancing timidly towards him).O husband! Pray forgive poor Beatrice.She meant not any ill.Cenci.Nor you perhaps?Nor that young imp, whom you have taught by roteParricide with his alphabet? Nor Giacomo?Nor those two most unnatural sons, who stirredEnmity up against me with the Pope?Whom in one night merciful God cut off:Innocent lambs! They thought not any ill.You were not here conspiring? You said nothingOf how I might be dungeoned as a madman;Or be condemned to death for some offence,And you would be the witnesses?-This failing,How just it were to hire assassins, orPut sudden poison in my evening drink?Or smother me when overcome by wine?Seeing we had no other judge but God,And He had sentenced me, and there were noneBut you to be the executionersOf His decree enregistered in Heaven?Oh, no! You said not this?Lucretia.So help me God,I never thought the things you charge me with!Cenci.If you dare speak that wicked lie againI'll kill you. What! It was not by your counselThat Beatrice disturbed the feast last night?You did not hope to stir some enemiesAgainst me, and escape, and laugh to scornWhat every nerve of you now trembles at?You judged that men were bolder than they are;Few dare to stand between their grave and me.Lucretia.Look not so dreadfully! By my salvationI knew not aught that Beatrice designed;Nor do I think she designed any thingUntil she heard you talk of her dead brothers.Cenci.Blaspheming liar! You are damned for this!But I will take you where you may persuadeThe stones you tread on to deliver you:For men shall there be none but those who dareAll things-not question that which I command.On Wednesday next I shall set out: you knowThat savage rock, the Castle of Petrella:'Tis safely walled, and moated round about:Its dungeons underground, and its thick towersNever told tales; though they have heard and seenWhat might make dumb things speak.-Why do you linger?Make speediest preparation for the journey! [Exit Lucretia.The all-beholding sun yet shines; I hearA busy stir of men about the streets;I see the bright sky through the window panes:It is a garish, broad, and peering day;Loud, light, suspicious, full of eyes and ears,And every little corner, nook, and holeIs penetrated with the insolent light.Come darkness! Yet, what is the day to me?And wherefore should I wish for night, who doA deed which shall confound both night and day?'Tis she shall grope through a bewildering mistOf horror: if there be a sun in heavenShe shall not dare to look upon its beams;Nor feel its warmth. Let her then wish for night;The act I think shall soon extinguish allFor me: I bear a darker deadlier gloomThan the earth's shade, or interlunar air,Or constellations quenched in murkiest cloud,In which I walk secure and unbeheldTowards my purpose.-Would that it were done![Exit.Scene II.-A Chamber in the Vatican. Enter Camillo and Giacomo, in conversation.Camillo.There is an obsolete and doubtful lawBy which you might obtain a bare provisionOf food and clothing-Giacomo.Nothing more? Alas!Bare must be the provision which strict lawAwards, and agèd, sullen avarice pays.Why did my father not apprentice meTo some mechanic trade? I should have thenBeen trained in no highborn necessitiesWhich I could meet not by my daily toil.The eldest son of a rich noblemanIs heir to all his incapacities;He has wide wants, and narrow powers. If you,Cardinal Camillo, were reduced at onceFrom thrice-driven beds of down, and delicate food,An hundred servants, and six palaces,To that which nature doth indeed require?-Camillo.Nay, there is reason in your plea; 'twere hard.Giacomo.'Tis hard for a firm man to bear: but IHave a dear wife, a lady of high birth,Whose dowry in ill hour I lent my fatherWithout a bond or witness to the deed:And children, who inherit her fine senses,The fairest creatures in this breathing world;And she and they reproach me not. Cardinal,Do you not think the Pope would interposeAnd stretch authority beyond the law?Camillo.Though your peculiar case is hard, I knowThe Pope will not divert the course of law.After that impious feast the other nightI spoke with him, and urged him then to checkYour father's cruel hand; he frowned and said,'Children are disobedient, and they stingTheir fathers' hearts to madness and despair,Requiting years of care with contumely.I pity the Count Cenci from my heart;His outraged love perhaps awakened hate,And thus he is exasperated to ill.In the great war between the old and youngI, who have white hairs and a tottering body,Will keep at least blameless neutrality.' Enter Orsino.You, my good Lord Orsino, heard those words.Orsino.What words?Giacomo.Alas, repeat them not again!There then is no redress for me, at leastNone but that which I may achieve myself,Since I am driven to the brink.-But, say,My innocent sister and my only brotherAre dying underneath my father's eye.The memorable torturers of this land,Galeaz Visconti, Borgia, Ezzelin,Never inflicted on the meanest slaveWhat these endure; shall they have no protection?Camillo.Why, if they would petition to the PopeI see not how he could refuse it-yetHe holds it of most dangerous exampleIn aught to weaken the paternal power,Being, as 'twere, the shadow of his own.I pray you now excuse me. I have businessThat will not bear delay.[Exit Camillo.Giacomo.But you, Orsino,Have the petition: wherefore not present it?Orsino.I have presented it, and backed it withMy earnest prayers, and urgent interest;It was returned unanswered. I doubt notBut that the strange and execrable deedsAlleged in it-in truth they might well baffleAny belief-have turned the Pope's displeasureUpon the accusers from the criminal:So I should guess from what Camillo said.Giacomo.My friend, that palace-walking devil GoldHas whispered silence to his Holiness:And we are left, as scorpions ringed with fire.What should we do but strike ourselves to death?For he who is our murderous persecutorIs shielded by a father's holy name,Or I would-[Stops abruptly.Orsino.What? Fear not to speak your thought.Words are but holy as the deeds they cover:A priest who has forsworn the God he serves;A judge who makes Truth weep at his decree;A friend who should weave counsel, as I now,But as the mantle of some selfish guile;A father who is all a tyrant seems,Were the profaner for his sacred name.Giacomo.Ask me not what I think; the unwilling brainFeigns often what it would not; and we trustImagination with such phantasiesAs the tongue dares not fashion into words,Which have no words, their horror makes them dimTo the mind's eye.-My heart denies itselfTo think what you demand.Orsino.But a friend's bosomIs as the inmost cave of our own mindWhere we sit shut from the wide gaze of day,And from the all-communicating air.You look what I suspected-Giacomo.Spare me now!I am as one lost in a midnight wood,Who dares not ask some harmless passengerThe path across the wilderness, lest he,As my thoughts are, should be-a murderer.I know you are my friend, and all I dareSpeak to my soul that will I trust with thee.But now my heart is heavy, and would takeLone counsel from a night of sleepless care.Pardon me, that I say farewell-farewell!I would that to my own suspected selfI could address a word so full of peace.Orsino.Farewell!-Be your thoughts better or more bold. [Exit Giacomo.I had disposed the Cardinal CamilloTo feed his hope with cold encouragement:It fortunately serves my close designsThat 'tis a trick of this same familyTo analyse their own and other minds.Such self-anatomy shall teach the willDangerous secrets: for it tempts our powers,Knowing what must be thought, and may be done,Into the depth of darkest purposes:So Cenci fell into the pit; even I,Since Beatrice unveiled me to myself,And made me shrink from what I cannot shun,Show a poor figure to my own esteem,To which I grow half reconciled. I'll doAs little mischief as I can; that thoughtShall fee the accuser conscience.(After a pause.)Now what harmIf Cenci should be murdered?-Yet, if murdered,Wherefore by me? And what if I could takeThe profit, yet omit the sin and perilIn such an action? Of all earthly thingsI fear a man whose blows outspeed his words;And such is Cenci: and while Cenci livesHis daughter's dowry were a secret graveIf a priest wins her.-Oh, fair Beatrice!Would that I loved thee not, or loving theeCould but despise danger and gold and allThat frowns between my wish and its effect,Or smiles beyond it! There is no escape . . .Her bright form kneels beside me at the altar,And follows me to the resort of men,And fills my slumber with tumultuous dreams,So when I wake my blood seems liquid fire;And if I strike my damp and dizzy headMy hot palm scorches it: her very name,But spoken by a stranger, makes my heartSicken and pant; and thus unprofitablyI clasp the phantom of unfelt delightsTill weak imagination half possessesThe self-created shadow. Yet much longerWill I not nurse this life of feverous hours:From the unravelled hopes of GiacomoI must work out my own dear purposes.I see, as from a tower, the end of all:Her father dead; her brother bound to meBy a dark secret, surer than the grave;Her mother scared and unexpostulatingFrom the dread manner of her wish achieved:And she!-Once more take courage, my faint heart;What dares a friendless maiden matched with thee?I have such foresight as assures success:Some unbeheld divinity doth ever,When dread events are near, stir up men's mindsTo black suggestions; and he prospers best,Not who becomes the instrument of ill,But who can flatter the dark spirit, that makesIts empire and its prey of other heartsTill it become his slave . . . as I will do.[Exit.END OF THE SECOND ACT.ACT IIIScene I.-An Apartment in the Cenci Palace. Lucretia, to her enter Beatrice.Beatrice.(She enters staggering, and speaks wildly.)Reach me that handkerchief!-My brain is hurt;My eyes are full of blood; just wipe them for me . . .I see but indistinctly . . .Lucretia.My sweet child,You have no wound; 'tis only a cold dewThat starts from your dear brow . . . Alas! Alas!What has befallen?Beatrice.How comes this hair undone?Its wandering strings must be what blind me so,And yet I tied it fast.-O, horrible!The pavement sinks under my feet! The wallsSpin round! I see a woman weeping there,And standing calm and motionless, whilst ISlide giddily as the world reels. . . . My God!The beautiful blue heaven is flecked with blood!The sunshine on the floor is black! The airIs changed to vapours such as the dead breatheIn charnel pits! Pah! I am choked! There creepsA clinging, black, contaminating mistAbout me . . . 'tis substantial, heavy, thick,I cannot pluck it from me, for it gluesMy fingers and my limbs to one another,And eats into my sinews, and dissolvesMy flesh to a pollution, poisoningThe subtle, pure, and inmost spirit of life!My God! I never knew what the mad feltBefore; for I am mad beyond all doubt!(More wildly.)No, I am dead! These putrefying limbsShut round and sepulchre the panting soulWhich would burst forth into the wandering air! (A pause.)What hideous thought was that I had even now?'Tis gone; and yet its burthen remains hereO'er these dull eyes . . . upon this weary heart!O, world! O, life! O, day! O, misery!Lucretia.What ails thee, my poor child? She answers not:Her spirit apprehends the sense of pain,But not its cause; suffering has dried awayThe source from which it sprung . . .Beatrice(franticly).Like Parricide . . .Misery has killed its father: yet its fatherNever like mine . . . O, God! What thing am I?Lucretia.My dearest child, what has your father done?Beatrice(doubtfully).Who art thou, questioner? I have no father.(Aside.)She is the madhouse nurse who tends on me,It is a piteous office.[To Lucretia, in a slow, subdued voice.Do you knowI thought I was that wretched BeatriceMen speak of, whom her father sometimes halesFrom hall to hall by the entangled hair;At others, pens up naked in damp cellsWhere scaly reptiles crawl, and starves her there,Till she will eat strange flesh. This woful storySo did I overact in my sick dreams,That I imagined . . . no, it cannot be!Horrible things have been in this wide world,Prodigious mixtures, and confusions strangeOf good and ill; and worse have been conceivedThan ever there was found a heart to do.But never fancy imaged such a deedAs . . .[Pauses, suddenly recollecting herself.Who art thou? Swear to me, ere I dieWith fearful expectation, that indeedThou art not what thou seemest . . . Mother!Lucretia.Oh!My sweet child, know you . . .Beatrice.Yet speak it not:For then if this be truth, that other tooMust be a truth, a firm enduring truth,Linked with each lasting circumstance of life,Never to change, never to pass away.Why so it is. This is the Cenci Palace;Thou art Lucretia; I am Beatrice.I have talked some wild words, but will no more.Mother, come near me: from this point of time,I am . . .[Her voice dies away faintly.Lucretia.Alas! What has befallen thee, child?What has thy father done?Beatrice.What have I done?Am I not innocent? Is it my crimeThat one with white hair, and imperious brow,Who tortured me from my forgotten years,As parents only dare, should call himselfMy father, yet should be!-Oh, what am I?What name, what place, what memory shall be mine?What retrospects, outliving even despair?Lucretia.He is a violent tyrant, surely, child:We know that death alone can make us free;His death or ours. But what can he have doneOf deadlier outrage or worse injury?Thou art unlike thyself; thine eyes shoot forthA wandering and strange spirit. Speak to me,Unlock those pallid hands whose fingers twineWith one another.Beatrice.'Tis the restless lifeTortured within them. If I try to speakI shall go mad. Ay, something must be done;What, yet I know not . . . something which shall makeThe thing that I have suffered but a shadowIn the dread lightning which avenges it;Brief, rapid, irreversible, destroyingThe consequence of what it cannot cure.Some such thing is to be endured or done:When I know what, I shall be still and calm,And never anything will move me more.But now!-O blood, which art my father's blood,Circling through these contaminated veins,If thou, poured forth on the polluted earth,Could wash away the crime, and punishmentBy which I suffer . . . no, that cannot be!Many might doubt there were a God aboveWho sees and permits evil, and so die:That faith no agony shall obscure in me.Lucretia.It must indeed have been some bitter wrong;Yet what, I dare not guess. Oh, my lost child,Hide not in proud impenetrable griefThy sufferings from my fear.Beatrice.I hide them not.What are the words which you would have me speak?I, who can feign no image in my mindOf that which has transformed me: I, whose thoughtIs like a ghost shrouded and folded upIn its own formless horror: of all words,That minister to mortal intercourse,Which wouldst thou hear? For there is none to tellMy misery: if another ever knewAught like to it, she died as I will die,And left it, as I must, without a name.Death! Death! Our law and our religion call theeA punishment and a reward . . . Oh, whichHave I deserved?Lucretia.The peace of innocence;Till in your season you be called to heaven.Whate'er you may have suffered, you have doneNo evil. Death must be the punishmentOf crime, or the reward of trampling downThe thorns which God has strewed upon the pathWhich leads to immortality.Beatrice.Ay; death . . .The punishment of crime. I pray thee, God,Let me not be bewildered while I judge.If I must live day after day, and keepThese limbs, the unworthy temple of Thy spirit,As a foul den from which what Thou abhorrestMay mock Thee, unavenged . . . it shall not be!Self-murder . . . no, that might be no escape,For Thy decree yawns like a Hell betweenOur will and it:-O! In this mortal worldThere is no vindication and no lawWhich can adjudge and execute the doomOf that through which I suffer.Enter Orsino.(She approaches him solemnly.)Welcome, Friend!I have to tell you that, since last we met,I have endured a wrong so great and strange,That neither life nor death can give me rest.Ask me not what it is, for there are deedsWhich have no form, sufferings which have no tongue.Orsino.And what is he who has thus injured you?Beatrice.The man they call my father: a dread name.Orsino.It cannot be . . .Beatrice.What it can be, or not,Forbear to think. It is, and it has been;Advise me how it shall not be again.I thought to die; but a religious aweRestrains me, and the dread lest death itselfMight be no refuge from the consciousnessOf what is yet unexpiated. Oh, speak!Orsino.Accuse him of the deed, and let the lawAvenge thee.Beatrice.Oh, ice-hearted counsellor!If I could find a word that might make knownThe crime of my destroyer; and that done,My tongue should like a knife tear out the secretWhich cankers my heart's core; ay, lay all bareSo that my unpolluted fame should beWith vilest gossips a stale mouthèd story;A mock, a byword, an astonishment:-If this were done, which never shall be done,Think of the offender's gold, his dreaded hate,And the strange horror of the accuser's tale,Baffling belief, and overpowering speech;Scarce whispered, unimaginable, wrappedIn hideous hints . . . Oh, most assured redress!Orsino.You will endure it then?Beatrice.Endure?-Orsino,It seems your counsel is small profit.[Turns from him, and speaks half to herself.Ay,All must be suddenly resolved and done.What is this undistinguishable mistOf thoughts, which rise, like shadow after shadow,Darkening each other?Orsino.Should the offender live?Triumph in his misdeed? and make, by use,His crime, whate'er it is, dreadful no doubt,Thine element; until thou mayst becomeUtterly lost; subdued even to the hueOf that which thou permittest?Beatrice(to herself).Mighty death!Thou double-visaged shadow? Only judge!Rightfullest arbiter![She retires absorbed in thought.Lucretia.If the lightningOf God has e'er descended to avenge . . .Orsino.Blaspheme not! His high Providence commitsIts glory on this earth, and their own wrongsInto the hands of men; if they neglectTo punish crime . . .Lucretia.But if one, like this wretch,Should mock, with gold, opinion, law, and power?If there be no appeal to that which makesThe guiltiest tremble? If because our wrongs,For that they are unnatural, strange, and monstrous,Exceed all measure of belief? O God!If, for the very reasons which should makeRedress most swift and sure, our injurer triumphs?And we, the victims, bear worse punishmentThan that appointed for their torturer?Orsino.Think notBut that there is redress where there is wrong,So we be bold enough to seize it.Lucretia.How?If there were any way to make all sure,I know not . . . but I think it might be goodTo . . .Orsino.Why, his late outrage to Beatrice;For it is such, as I but faintly guess,As makes remorse dishonour, and leaves herOnly one duty, how she may avenge:You, but one refuge from ills ill endured;Me, but one counsel . . .Lucretia.For we cannot hopeThat aid, or retribution, or resourceWill arise thence, where every other oneMight find them with less need.[Beatrice advances.Orsino.Then . . .Beatrice.Peace, Orsino!And, honoured Lady, while I speak, I pray,That you put off, as garments overworn,Forbearance and respect, remorse and fear,And all the fit restraints of daily life,Which have been borne from childhood, but which nowWould be a mockery to my holier plea.As I have said, I have endured a wrong,Which, though it be expressionless, is suchAs asks atonement; both for what is past,And lest I be reserved, day after day,To load with crimes an overburthened soul,And be . . . what ye can dream not. I have prayedTo God, and I have talked with my own heart,And have unravelled my entangled will,And have at length determined what is right.Art thou my friend, Orsino? False or true?Pledge thy salvation ere I speak.Orsino.I swearTo dedicate my cunning, and my strength,My silence, and whatever else is mine,To thy commands.Lucretia.You think we should deviseHis death?Beatrice.And execute what is devised,And suddenly. We must be brief and bold.Orsino.And yet most cautious.Lucretia.For the jealous lawsWould punish us with death and infamyFor that which it became themselves to do.Beatrice.Be cautious as ye may, but prompt. Orsino,What are the means?Orsino.I know two dull, fierce outlaws,Who think man's spirit as a worm's, and theyWould trample out, for any slight caprice,The meanest or the noblest life. This moodIs marketable here in Rome. They sellWhat we now want.Lucretia.To-morrow before dawn,Cenci will take us to that lonely rock,Petrella, in the Apulian Apennines.If he arrive there . . .Beatrice.He must not arrive.Orsino.Will it be dark before you reach the tower?Lucretia.The sun will scarce be set.Beatrice.But I rememberTwo miles on this side of the fort, the roadCrosses a deep ravine; 'tis rough and narrow,And winds with short turns down the precipice;And in its depth there is a mighty rock,Which has, from unimaginable years,Sustained itself with terror and with toilOver a gulf, and with the agonyWith which it clings seems slowly coming down;Even as a wretched soul hour after hour,Clings to the mass of life; yet clinging, leans;And leaning, makes more dark the dread abyssIn which it fears to fall: beneath this cragHuge as despair, as if in weariness,The melancholy mountain yawns . . . below,You hear but see not an impetuous torrentRaging among the caverns, and a bridgeCrosses the chasm; and high above there grow,With intersecting trunks, from crag to crag,Cedars, and yews, and pines; whose tangled hairIs matted in one solid roof of shadeBy the dark ivy's twine. At noonday here'Tis twilight, and at sunset blackest night.Orsino.Before you reach that bridge make some excuseFor spurring on your mules, or loiteringUntil . . .Beatrice.What sound is that?Lucretia.Hark! No, it cannot be a servant's stepIt must be Cenci, unexpectedlyReturned . . . Make some excuse for being here.Beatrice.(To Orsino, as she goes out.)That step we hear approach must never passThe bridge of which we spoke.[Exeunt Lucretia and Beatrice.Orsino.What shall I do?Cenci must find me here, and I must bearThe imperious inquisition of his looksAs to what brought me hither: let me maskMine own in some inane and vacant smile. Enter Giacomo, in a hurried manner.How! Have you ventured hither? Know you thenThat Cenci is from home?Giacomo.I sought him here;And now must wait till he returns.Orsino.Great God!Weigh you the danger of this rashness?Giacomo.Ay!Does my destroyer know his danger? WeAre now no more, as once, parent and child,But man to man; the oppressor to the oppressed;The slanderer to the slandered; foe to foe:He has cast Nature off, which was his shield,And Nature casts him off, who is her shame;And I spurn both. Is it a father's throatWhich I will shake, and say, I ask not gold;I ask not happy years; nor memoriesOf tranquil childhood; nor home-sheltered love;Though all these hast thou torn from me, and more;But only my fair fame; only one hoardOf peace, which I thought hidden from thy hate,Under the penury heaped on me by thee,Or I will . . . God can understand and pardon,Why should I speak with man?Orsino.Be calm, dear friend.Giacomo.Well, I will calmly tell you what he did.This old Francesco Cenci, as you know,Borrowed the dowry of my wife from me,And then denied the loan; and left me soIn poverty, the which I sought to mendBy holding a poor office in the state.It had been promised to me, and alreadyI bought new clothing for my raggèd babes,And my wife smiled; and my heart knew repose.When Cenci's intercession, as I found,Conferred this office on a wretch, whom thusHe paid for vilest service. I returnedWith this ill news, and we sate sad togetherSolacing our despondency with tearsOf such affection and unbroken faithAs temper life's worst bitterness; when he,As he is wont, came to upbraid and curse,Mocking our poverty, and telling usSuch was God's scourge for disobedient sons.And then, that I might strike him dumb with shame,I spoke of my wife's dowry; but he coinedA brief yet specious tale, how I had wastedThe sum in secret riot; and he sawMy wife was touched, and he went smiling forth.And when I knew the impression he had made,And felt my wife insult with silent scornMy ardent truth, and look averse and cold,I went forth too: but soon returned again;Yet not so soon but that my wife had taughtMy children her harsh thoughts, and they all cried,'Give us clothes, father! Give us better food!What you in one night squander were enoughFor months!' I looked, and saw that home was hell.And to that hell will I return no moreUntil mine enemy has rendered upAtonement, or, as he gave life to meI will, reversing Nature's law . . .Orsino.Trust me,The compensation which thou seekest hereWill be denied.Giacomo.Then . . . Are you not my friend?Did you not hint at the alternative,Upon the brink of which you see I stand,The other day when we conversed together?My wrongs were then less. That word parricide,Although I am resolved, haunts me like fear.Orsino.It must be fear itself, for the bare wordIs hollow mockery. Mark, how wisest GodDraws to one point the threads of a just doom,So sanctifying it: what you deviseIs, as it were, accomplished.Giacomo.Is he dead?Orsino.His grave is ready. Know that since we metCenci has done an outrage to his daughter.Giacomo.What outrage?Orsino.That she speaks not, but you mayConceive such half conjectures as I do,From her fixed paleness, and the lofty griefOf her stern brow bent on the idle air,And her severe unmodulated voice,Drowning both tenderness and dread; and lastFrom this; that whilst her step-mother and I,Bewildered in our horror, talked togetherWith obscure hints; both self-misunderstoodAnd darkly guessing, stumbling, in our talk,Over the truth, and yet to its revenge,She interrupted us, and with a lookWhich told before she spoke it, he must die: . . .Giacomo.It is enough. My doubts are well appeased;There is a higher reason for the actThan mine; there is a holier judge than me,A more unblamed avenger. Beatrice,Who in the gentleness of thy sweet youthHast never trodden on a worm, or bruisedA living flower, but thou hast pitied itWith needless tears! Fair sister, thou in whomMen wondered how such loveliness and wisdomDid not destroy each other! Is there madeRavage of thee? O, heart, I ask no moreJustification! Shall I wait, Orsino,Till he return, and stab him at the door?Orsino.Not so; some accident might interposeTo rescue him from what is now most sure;And you are unprovided where to fly,How to excuse or to conceal. Nay, listen:All is contrived; success is so assuredThat . . .Enter Beatrice.Beatrice.'Tis my brother's voice! You know me not?Giacomo.My sister, my lost sister!Beatrice.Lost indeed!I see Orsino has talked with you, andThat you conjecture things too horribleTo speak, yet far less than the truth. Now, stay not,He might return: yet kiss me; I shall knowThat then thou hast consented to his death.Farewell, farewell! Let piety to God,Brotherly love, justice and clemency,And all things that make tender hardest heartsMake thine hard, brother. Answer not . . . farewell.[Exeunt severally.Scene II.-A mean Apartment in Giacomo's House. Giacomo alone.Giacomo.'Tis midnight, and Orsino comes not yet. [Thunder, and the sound of a storm.What! can the everlasting elementsFeel with a worm like man? If so, the shaftOf mercy-wingèd lightning would not fallOn stones and trees. My wife and children sleep:They are now living in unmeaning dreams:But I must wake, still doubting if that deedBe just which is most necessary. O,Thou unreplenished lamp! whose narrow fireIs shaken by the wind, and on whose edgeDevouring darkness hovers! Thou small flame,Which, as a dying pulse rises and falls,Still flickerest up and down, how very soon,Did I not feed thee, wouldst thou fail and beAs thou hadst never been! So wastes and sinksEven now, perhaps, the life that kindled mine:But that no power can fill with vital oilThat broken lamp of flesh. Ha! 'tis the bloodWhich fed these veins that ebbs till all is cold:It is the form that moulded mine that sinksInto the white and yellow spasms of death:It is the soul by which mine was arrayedIn God's immortal likeness which now standsNaked before Heaven's judgement seat![A bell strikes.One! Two!The hours crawl on; and when my hairs are white,My son will then perhaps be waiting thus,Tortured between just hate and vain remorse;Chiding the tardy messenger of newsLike those which I expect. I almost wishHe be not dead, although my wrongs are great;Yet . . . 'tis Orsino's step . . .Enter Orsino.Speak!Orsino.I am comeTo say he has escaped.Giacomo.Escaped!Orsino.And safeWithin Petrella. He passed by the spotAppointed for the deed an hour too soon.Giacomo.Are we the fools of such contingencies?And do we waste in blind misgivings thusThe hours when we should act? Then wind and thunder,Which seemed to howl his knell, is the loud laughterWith which Heaven mocks our weakness! I henceforthWill ne'er repent of aught designed or doneBut my repentance.Orsino.See, the lamp is out.Giacomo.If no remorse is ours when the dim airHas drank this innocent flame, why should we quailWhen Cenci's life, that light by which ill spiritsSee the worst deeds they prompt, shall sink for ever?No, I am hardened.Orsino.Why, what need of this?Who feared the pale intrusion of remorseIn a just deed? Although our first plan failed,Doubt not but he will soon be laid to rest.But light the lamp; let us not talk i' the dark.Giacomo(lighting the lamp).And yet once quenched I cannot thus relumeMy father's life: do you not think his ghostMight plead that argument with God?Orsino.Once goneYou cannot now recall your sister's peace;Your own extinguished years of youth and hope;Nor your wife's bitter words; nor all the tauntsWhich, from the prosperous, weak misfortune takes;Nor your dead mother; nor . . .Giacomo.O, speak no more!I am resolved, although this very handMust quench the life that animated it.Orsino.There is no need of that. Listen: you knowOlimpio, the castellan of PetrellaIn old Colonna's time; him whom your fatherDegraded from his post? And Marzio,That desperate wretch, whom he deprived last yearOf a reward of blood, well earned and due?Giacomo.I knew Olimpio; and they say he hatedOld Cenci so, that in his silent rageHis lips grew white only to see him pass.Of Marzio I know nothing.Orsino.Marzio's hateMatches Olimpio's. I have sent these men,But in your name, and as at your request,To talk with Beatrice and Lucretia.Giacomo.Only to talk?Orsino.The moments which even nowPass onward to to-morrow's midnight hourMay memorize their flight with death: ere thenThey must have talked, and may perhaps have done,And made an end . . .Giacomo.Listen! What sound is that?Orsino.The house-dog moans, and the beams crack: nought else.Giacomo.It is my wife complaining in her sleep:I doubt not she is saying bitter thingsOf me; and all my children round her dreamingThat I deny them sustenance.Orsino.Whilst heWho truly took it from them, and who fillsTheir hungry rest with bitterness, now sleepsLapped in bad pleasures, and triumphantlyMocks thee in visions of successful hateToo like the truth of day.Giacomo.If e'er he wakesAgain, I will not trust to hireling hands . . .Orsino.Why, that were well. I must be gone; good-night.When next we meet-may all be done!Giacomo.And allForgotten: Oh, that I had never been![Exeunt.END OF THE THIRD ACT.ACT IVScene I.-An Apartment in the Castle of Petrella. Enter Cenci.Cenci.She comes not; yet I left her even nowVanquished and faint. She knows the penaltyOf her delay: yet what if threats are vain?Am I not now within Petrella's moat?Or fear I still the eyes and ears of Rome?Might I not drag her by the golden hair?Stamp on her? Keep her sleepless till her brainBe overworn? Tame her with chains and famine?Less would suffice. Yet so to leave undoneWhat I most seek! No, 'tis her stubborn willWhich by its own consent shall stoop as lowAs that which drags it down.Enter Lucretia.Thou loathèd wretch!Hide thee from my abhorrence: fly, begone!Yet stay! Bid Beatrice come hither.Lucretia.Oh,Husband! I pray for thine own wretched sakeHeed what thou dost. A man who walks like theeThrough crimes, and through the danger of his crimes,Each hour may stumble o'er a sudden grave.And thou art old; thy hairs are hoary gray;As thou wouldst save thyself from death and hell,Pity thy daughter; give her to some friendIn marriage: so that she may tempt thee notTo hatred, or worse thoughts, if worse there be.Cenci.What! like her sister who has found a homeTo mock my hate from with prosperity?Strange ruin shall destroy both her and theeAnd all that yet remain. My death may beRapid, her destiny outspeeds it. Go,Bid her come hither, and before my moodBe changed, lest I should drag her by the hair.Lucretia.She sent me to thee, husband. At thy presenceShe fell, as thou dost know, into a trance;And in that trance she heard a voice which said,'Cenci must die! Let him confess himself!Even now the accusing Angel waits to hearIf God, to punish his enormous crimes,Harden his dying heart!'Cenci.Why-such things are . . .No doubt divine revealings may be made.'Tis plain I have been favoured from above,For when I cursed my sons they died.-Ay . . . so . . .As to the right or wrong, that's talk . . . repentance . . .Repentance is an easy moment's workAnd more depends on God than me. Well . . . well . . .I must give up the greater point, which wasTo poison and corrupt her soul.[A pause; Lucretia approaches anxiously, and then shrinks back as he speaks.One, two;Ay . . . Rocco and Cristofano my curseStrangled: and Giacomo, I think, will findLife a worse Hell than that beyond the grave:Beatrice shall, if there be skill in hate,Die in despair, blaspheming: to Bernardo,He is so innocent, I will bequeathThe memory of these deeds, and make his youthThe sepulchre of hope, where evil thoughtsShall grow like weeds on a neglected tomb.When all is done, out in the wide Campagna,I will pile up my silver and my gold;My costly robes, paintings and tapestries;My parchments and all records of my wealth,And make a bonfire in my joy, and leaveOf my possessions nothing but my name;Which shall be an inheritance to stripIts wearer bare as infamy. That done,My soul, which is a scourge, will I resignInto the hands of him who wielded it;Be it for its own punishment or theirs,He will not ask it of me till the lashBe broken in its last and deepest wound;Until its hate be all inflicted. Yet,Lest death outspeed my purpose, let me makeShort work and sure . . .[Going.Lucretia.(Stops him.)Oh, stay! It was a feint:She had no vision, and she heard no voice.I said it but to awe thee.Cenci.That is well.Vile palterer with the sacred truth of God,Be thy soul choked with that blaspheming lie!For Beatrice worse terrors are in storeTo bend her to my will.Lucretia.Oh! to what will?What cruel sufferings more than she has knownCanst thou inflict?Cenci.Andrea! Go call my daughter,And if she comes not tell her that I come.What sufferings? I will drag her, step by step,Through infamies unheard of among men:She shall stand shelterless in the broad noonOf public scorn, for acts blazoned abroad,One among which shall be . . . What? Canst thou guess?She shall become (for what she most abhorsShall have a fascination to entrapHer loathing will) to her own conscious selfAll she appears to others; and when dead,As she shall die unshrived and unforgiven,A rebel to her father and her God,Her corpse shall be abandoned to the hounds;Her name shall be the terror of the earth;Her spirit shall approach the throne of GodPlague-spotted with my curses. I will makeBody and soul a monstrous lump of ruin.Enter Andrea.Andrea.The Lady Beatrice . . .Cenci.Speak, pale slave! WhatSaid she?Andrea.My Lord, 'twas what she looked; she said:'Go tell my father that I see the gulfOf Hell between us two, which he may pass,I will not.'[Exit Andrea.Cenci.Go thou quick, Lucretia,Tell her to come; yet let her understandHer coming is consent: and say, moreover,That if she come not I will curse her.[Exit Lucretia.Ha!With what but with a father's curse doth GodPanic-strike armèd victory, and make paleCities in their prosperity? The world's FatherMust grant a parent's prayer against his child,Be he who asks even what men call me.Will not the deaths of her rebellious brothersAwe her before I speak? For I on themDid imprecate quick ruin, and it came. Enter Lucretia.Well; what? Speak, wretch!Lucretia.She said, 'I cannot come;Go tell my father that I see a torrentOf his own blood raging between us.'Cenci(kneeling).God!Hear me! If this most specious mass of flesh,Which Thou hast made my daughter; this my blood,This particle of my divided being;Or rather, this my bane and my disease,Whose sight infects and poisons me; this devilWhich sprung from me as from a hell, was meantTo aught good use; if her bright lovelinessWas kindled to illumine this dark world;If nursed by Thy selectest dew of loveSuch virtues blossom in her as should makeThe peace of life, I pray Thee for my sake,As Thou the common God and Father artOf her, and me, and all; reverse that doom!Earth, in the name of God, let her food bePoison, until she be encrusted roundWith leprous stains! Heaven, rain upon her headThe blistering drops of the Maremma's dew,Till she be speckled like a toad; parch upThose love-enkindled lips, warp those fine limbsTo loathèd lameness! All-beholding sun,Strike in thine envy those life-darting eyesWith thine own blinding beams!Lucretia.Peace! Peace!For thine own sake unsay those dreadful words.When high God grants He punishes such prayers.Cenci(leaping up, and throwing his right hand towards Heaven).He does His will, I mine! This in addition,That if she have a child . . .Lucretia.Horrible thought!Cenci.That if she ever have a child; and thou,Quick Nature! I adjure thee by thy God,That thou be fruitful in her, and increaseAnd multiply, fulfilling his command,And my deep imprecation! May it beA hideous likeness of herself, that asFrom a distorting mirror, she may seeHer image mixed with what she most abhors,Smiling upon her from her nursing breast.And that the child may from its infancyGrow, day by day, more wicked and deformed,Turning her mother's love to misery:And that both she and it may live untilIt shall repay her care and pain with hate,Or what may else be more unnatural.So he may hunt her through the clamorous scoffsOf the loud world to a dishonoured grave.Shall I revoke this curse? Go, bid her come,Before my words are chronicled in Heaven. [Exit Lucretia.I do not feel as if I were a man,But like a fiend appointed to chastiseThe offences of some unremembered world.My blood is running up and down my veins;A fearful pleasure makes it prick and tingle:I feel a giddy sickness of strange awe;My heart is beating with an expectationOf horrid joy.Enter Lucretia.What? Speak!Lucretia.She bids thee curse;And if thy curses, as they cannot do,Could kill her soul . . .Cenci.She would not come. 'Tis well,I can do both: first take what I demand,And then extort concession. To thy chamber!Fly ere I spurn thee: and beware this nightThat thou cross not my footsteps. It were saferTo come between the tiger and his prey.[Exit Lucretia.It must be late; mine eyes grow weary dimWith unaccustomed heaviness of sleep.Conscience! Oh, thou most insolent of lies!They say that sleep, that healing dew of Heaven,Steeps not in balm the foldings of the brainWhich thinks thee an impostor. I will goFirst to belie thee with an hour of rest,Which will be deep and calm, I feel: and then . . .O, multitudinous Hell, the fiends will shake.Thine arches with the laughter of their joy!There shall be lamentation heard in HeavenAs o'er an angel fallen; and upon EarthAll good shall droop and sicken, and ill thingsShall with a spirit of unnatural lifeStir and be quickened . . . even as I am now.[Exit.Scene II.-Before the Castle of Petrella. Enter Beatrice andLucretia above on the Ramparts.Beatrice.They come not yet.Lucretia.'Tis scarce midnight.Beatrice.How slowBehind the course of thought, even sick with speed,Lags leaden-footed time!Lucretia.The minutes pass . . .If he should wake before the deed is done?Beatrice.O, mother! He must never wake again.What thou hast said persuades me that our actWill but dislodge a spirit of deep hellOut of a human form.Lucretia.'Tis true he spokeOf death and judgement with strange confidenceFor one so wicked; as a man believingIn God, yet recking not of good or ill.And yet to die without confession! . . .Beatrice.Oh!Believe that Heaven is merciful and just,And will not add our dread necessityTo the amount of his offences.Enter Olimpio and Marzio, below.Lucretia.See,They come.Beatrice.All mortal things must hasten thusTo their dark end. Let us go down.[Exeunt Lucretia and Beatrice from above.Olimpio.How feel you to this work?Marzio.As one who thinksA thousand crowns excellent market priceFor an old murderer's life. Your cheeks are pale.Olimpio.It is the white reflection of your own,Which you call pale.Marzio.Is that their natural hue?Olimpio.Or 'tis my hate and the deferred desireTo wreak it, which extinguishes their blood.Marzio.You are inclined then to this business?Olimpio.Ay.If one should bribe me with a thousand crownsTo kill a serpent which had stung my child,I could not be more willing.Enter Beatrice and Lucretia, below.Noble ladies!Beatrice.Are ye resolved?Olimpio.Is he asleep?Marzio.Is allQuiet?Lucretia.I mixed an opiate with his drink:He sleeps so soundly . . .Beatrice.That his death will beBut as a change of sin-chastising dreams,A dark continuance of the Hell within him,Which God extinguish! But ye are resolved?Ye know it is a high and holy deed?Olimpio.We are resolved.Marzio.As to the how this actBe warranted, it rests with you.Beatrice.Well, follow!Olimpio.Hush! Hark! What noise is that?Marzio.Ha! some one comes!Beatrice.Ye conscience-stricken cravens, rock to restYour baby hearts. It is the iron gate,Which ye left open, swinging to the wind,That enters whistling as in scorn. Come, follow!And be your steps like mine, light, quick and bold.[Exeunt.Scene III.-An Apartment in the Castle. Enter Beatrice and Lucretia.Lucretia.They are about it now.Beatrice.Nay, it is done.Lucretia.I have not heard him groan.Beatrice.He will not groan.Lucretia.What sound is that?Beatrice.List! 'tis the tread of feetAbout his bed.Lucretia.My God!If he be now a cold stiff corpse . . .Beatrice.O, fear notWhat may be done, but what is left undone:The act seals all.Enter Olimpio and Marzio.Is it accomplished?Marzio.What?Olimpio.Did you not call?Beatrice.When?Olimpio.Now.Beatrice.I ask if all is over?Olimpio.We dare not kill an old and sleeping man;His thin gray hair, his stern and reverend brow,His veinèd hands crossed on his heaving breast,And the calm innocent sleep in which he lay,Quelled me. Indeed, indeed, I cannot do it.Marzio.But I was bolder; for I chid Olimpio,And bade him bear his wrongs to his own graveAnd leave me the reward. And now my knifeTouched the loose wrinkled throat, when the old manStirred in his sleep, and said, 'God! hear, O, hear,A father's curse! What, art Thou not our Father?'And then he laughed. I knew it was the ghostOf my dead father speaking through his lips,And could not kill him.Beatrice.Miserable slaves!Where, if ye dare not kill a sleeping man,Found ye the boldness to return to meWith such a deed undone? Base palterers!Cowards and traitors! Why, the very conscienceWhich ye would sell for gold and for revengeIs an equivocation: it sleeps overA thousand daily acts disgracing men;And when a deed where mercy insults Heaven . . .Why do I talk?[Snatching a dagger from one of them and raising it.Hadst thou a tongue to say,'She murdered her own father!'-I must do it!But never dream ye shall outlive him long!Olimpio.Stop, for God's sake!Marzio.I will go back and kill him.Olimpio.Give me the weapon. we must do thy will.Beatrice.Take it! Depart! Return![Exeunt Olimpio and Marzio.How pale thou art!We do but that which 'twere a deadly crimeTo leave undone.Lucretia.Would it were done!Beatrice.Even whilstThat doubt is passing through your mind, the worldIs conscious of a change. Darkness and HellHave swallowed up the vapour they sent forthTo blacken the sweet light of life. My breathComes, methinks, lighter, and the jellied bloodRuns freely through my veins. Hark!Enter Olimpio and Marzio.He is . . .Olimpio.Dead!Marzio.We strangled him that there might be no blood;And then we threw his heavy corpse i' the gardenUnder the balcony; 'twill seem it fell.Beatrice(giving them a bag of coin).Here, take this gold, and hasten to your homes.And, Marzio, because thou wast only awedBy that which made me tremble, wear thou this! [Clothes him in a rich mantle.It was the mantle which my grandfatherWore in his high prosperity, and menEnvied his state: so may they envy thine.Thou wert a weapon in the hand of GodTo a just use. Live long and thrive! And, mark,If thou hast crimes, repent: this deed is none.[A horn is sounded.Lucretia.Hark, 'tis the castle horn; my God! it soundsLike the last trump.BeatriceSome tedious guest is coming.Lucretia.The drawbridge is let down; there is a trampOf horses in the court; fly, hide yourselves![Exeunt Olimpio and Marzio.Beatrice.Let us retire to counterfeit deep rest;I scarcely need to counterfeit it now:The spirit which doth reign within these limbsSeems strangely undisturbed. I could even sleepFearless and calm: all ill is surely past.[Exeunt.Scene IV.-Another Apartment in the Castle. Enter on one side the Legate Savella, introduced by a Servant, and on the other Lucretia and Bernardo.Savella.Lady, my duty to his HolinessBe my excuse that thus unseasonablyI break upon your rest. I must speak withCount Cenci; doth he sleep?Lucretia(in a hurried and confused manner).I think he sleeps;Yet wake him not, I pray, spare me awhile,He is a wicked and a wrathful man;Should he be roused out of his sleep to-night,Which is, I know, a hell of angry dreams,It were not well; indeed it were not well.Wait till day break . . . (aside)O, I am deadly sick!Savella.I grieve thus to distress you, but the CountMust answer charges of the gravest import,And suddenly; such my commission is.Lucretia(with increased agitation).I dare not rouse him: I know none who dare . . .'Twere perilous; . . . you might as safely wakenA serpent; or a corpse in which some fiendWere laid to sleep.Savella.Lady, my moments hereAre counted. I must rouse him from his sleep,Since none else dare.Lucretia(aside).O, terror! O, despair!(To Bernardo.)Bernardo, conduct you the Lord Legate toYour father's chamber.[Exeunt Savella and Bernardo.Enter Beatrice.Beatrice.'Tis a messengerCome to arrest the culprit who now standsBefore the throne of unappealable God.Both Earth and Heaven, consenting arbiters,Acquit our deed.Lucretia.Oh, agony of fear!Would that he yet might live! Even now I heardThe Legate's followers whisper as they passedThey had a warrant for his instant death.All was prepared by unforbidden meansWhich we must pay so dearly, having done.Even now they search the tower, and find the body;Now they suspect the truth; now they consultBefore they come to tax us with the fact;O, horrible, 'tis all discovered!Beatrice.Mother,What is done wisely, is done well. Be boldAs thou art just. 'Tis like a truant childTo fear that others know what thou hast done,Even from thine own strong consciousness, and thusWrite on unsteady eyes and altered cheeksAll thou wouldst hide. Be faithful to thyself,And fear no other witness but thy fear.For if, as cannot be, some circumstanceShould rise in accusation, we can blindSuspicion with such cheap astonishment,Or overbear it with such guiltless pride,As murderers cannot feign. The deed is done,And what may follow now regards not me.I am as universal as the light;Free as the earth-surrounding air; as firmAs the world's centre. Consequence, to me,Is as the wind which strikes the solid rockBut shakes it not.[A cry within and tumult.Voices.Murder! Murder! Murder!Enter Bernardo and Savella.Savella(to his followers).Go search the castle round; sound the alarm;Look to the gates that none escape!Beatrice.What now?Bernardo.I know not what to say . . . my father's dead.Beatrice.How; dead! he only sleeps; you mistake, brother.His sleep is very calm, very like death;'Tis wonderful how well a tyrant sleeps.He is not dead?Bernardo.Dead; murdered.Lucretia(with extreme agitation).Oh no, noHe is not murdered though he may be dead;I have alone the keys of those apartments.Savella.Ha! Is it so?Beatrice.My Lord, I pray excuse us;We will retire; my mother is not well:She seems quite overcome with this strange horror.[Exeunt Lucretia and Beatrice.Savella.Can you suspect who may have murdered him?Bernardo.I know not what to think.Savella.Can you name anyWho had an interest in his death?Bernardo.Alas!I can name none who had not, and those mostWho most lament that such a deed is done;My mother, and my sister, and myself.Savella.'Tis strange! There were clear marks of violence.I found the old man's body in the moonlightHanging beneath the window of his chamber,Among the branches of a pine: he could notHave fallen there, for all his limbs lay heapedAnd effortless; 'tis true there was no blood . . .Favour me, Sir; it much imports your houseThat all should be made clear; to tell the ladiesThat I request their presence.[Exit Bernardo.Enter Guards bringing in Marzio.Guard.We have one.Officer.My Lord, we found this ruffian and anotherLurking among the rocks; there is no doubtBut that they are the murderers of Count Cenci:Each had a bag of coin; this fellow woreA gold-inwoven robe, which shining brightUnder the dark rocks to the glimmering moonBetrayed them to our notice: the other fellDesperately fighting.Savella.What does he confess?Officer.He keeps firm silence; but these lines found on himMay speak.Savella.Their language is at least sincere.[Reads.'To the Lady Beatrice.'That the atonement of what my nature sickens to conjecture may soon arrive, I send thee, at thy brother's desire, those who will speak and do more than I dare write. . .'Thy devoted servant, Orsino.'Enter Lucretia, Beatrice, and Bernardo.Knowest thou this writing, Lady?Beatrice.No.Savella.Nor thou?Lucretia.(Her conduct throughout the scene is marked by extreme agitation.)Where was it found? What is it? It should beOrsino's hand! It speaks of that strange horrorWhich never yet found utterance, but which madeBetween that hapless child and her dead fatherA gulf of obscure hatred.Savella.Is it so?Is it true, Lady, that thy father didSuch outrages as to awaken in theeUnfilial hate?Beatrice.Not hate, 'twas more than hate:This is most true, yet wherefore question me?Savella.There is a deed demanding question done;Thou hast a secret which will answer not.Beatrice.What sayest? My Lord, your words are bold and rash.Savella.I do arrest all present in the nameOf the Pope's Holiness. You must to Rome.Lucretia.O, not to Rome! Indeed we are not guilty.Beatrice.Guilty! Who dares talk of guilt? My Lord,I am more innocent of parricideThan is a child born fatherless . . . Dear mother,Your gentleness and patience are no shieldFor this keen-judging world, this two-edged lie,Which seems, but is not. What! will human laws,Rather will ye who are their ministers,Bar all access to retribution first,And then, when Heaven doth interpose to doWhat ye neglect, arming familiar thingsTo the redress of an unwonted crime,Make ye the victims who demanded itCulprits? 'Tis ye are culprits! That poor wretchWho stands so pale, and trembling, and amazed,If it be true he murdered Cenci, wasA sword in the right hand of justest God.Wherefore should I have wielded it? UnlessThe crimes which mortal tongue dare never nameGod therefore scruples to avenge.Savella.You ownThat you desired his death?Beatrice.It would have beenA crime no less than his, if for one momentThat fierce desire had faded in my heart.'Tis true I did believe, and hope, and pray,Ay, I even knew . . . for God is wise and just,That some strange sudden death hung over him.'Tis true that this did happen, and most trueThere was no other rest for me on earth,No other hope in Heaven . . . now what of this?Savella.Strange thoughts beget strange deeds; and here are both:I judge thee not.Beatrice.And yet, if you arrest me,You are the judge and executionerOf that which is the life of life: the breathOf accusation kills an innocent name,And leaves for lame acquittal the poor lifeWhich is a mask without it. 'Tis most falseThat I am guilty of foul parricide;Although I must rejoice, for justest cause,That other hands have sent my father's soulTo ask the mercy he denied to me.Now leave us free; stain not a noble houseWith vague surmises of rejected crime;Add to our sufferings and your own neglectNo heavier sum: let them have been enough:Leave us the wreck we have.Savella.I dare not, Lady.I pray that you prepare yourselves for Rome:There the Pope's further pleasure will be known.Lucretia.O, not to Rome! O, take us not to Rome!Beatrice.Why not to Rome, dear mother? There as hereOur innocence is as an armèd heelTo trample accusation. God is thereAs here, and with His shadow ever clothesThe innocent, the injured and the weak;And such are we. Cheer up, dear Lady, leanOn me; collect your wandering thoughts. My Lord,As soon as you have taken some refreshment,And had all such examinations madeUpon the spot, as may be necessaryTo the full understanding of this matter,We shall be ready. Mother; will you come?Lucretia.Ha! they will bind us to the rack, and wrestSelf-accusation from our agony!Will Giacomo be there? Orsino? Marzio?All present; all confronted; all demandingEach from the other's countenance the thingWhich is in every heart! O, misery![She faints, and is borne out.Savella.She faints: an ill appearance this.Beatrice.My Lord,She knows not yet the uses of the world.She fears that power is as a beast which graspsAnd loosens not: a snake whose look transmutesAll things to guilt which is its nutriment.She cannot know how well the supine slavesOf blind authority read the truth of thingsWhen written on a brow of guilelessness:She sees not yet triumphant InnocenceStand at the judgement-seat of mortal man,A judge and an accuser of the wrongWhich drags it there. Prepare yourself, my Lord;Our suite will join yours in the court below.[Exeunt.END OF THE FOURTH ACT.ACT VScene I.-An Apartment in Orsino's Palace. Enter Orsino and Giacomo.Giacomo.Do evil deeds thus quickly come to end?O, that the vain remorse which must chastiseCrimes done, had but as loud a voice to warnAs its keen sting is mortal to avenge!O, that the hour when present had cast offThe mantle of its mystery, and shownThe ghastly form with which it now returnsWhen its scared game is roused, cheering the houndsOf conscience to their prey! Alas! Alas!It was a wicked thought, a piteous deed,To kill an old and hoary-headed father.Orsino.It has turned out unluckily, in truth.Giacomo.To violate the sacred doors of sleep;To cheat kind Nature of the placid deathWhich she prepares for overwearied age;To drag from Heaven an unrepentant soulWhich might have quenched in reconciling prayersA life of burning crimes . . .Orsino.You cannot sayI urged you to the deed.Giacomo.O, had I neverFound in thy smooth and ready countenanceThe mirror of my darkest thoughts; hadst thouNever with hints and questions made me lookUpon the monster of my thought, untilIt grew familiar to desire . . .Orsino.'Tis thusMen cast the blame of their unprosperous actsUpon the abettors of their own resolve;Or anything but their weak, guilty selves.And yet, confess the truth, it is the perilIn which you stand that gives you this pale sicknessOf penitence; confess 'tis fear disguisedFrom its own shame that takes the mantle nowOf thin remorse. What if we yet were safe?Giacomo.How can that be? Already Beatrice,Lucretia and the murderer are in prison.I doubt not officers are, whilst we speak,Sent to arrest us.Orsino.I have all preparedFor instant flight. We can escape even now,So we take fleet occasion by the hair.Giacomo.Rather expire in tortures, as I may.What! will you cast by self-accusing flightAssured conviction upon Beatrice?She, who alone in this unnatural work,Stands like God's angel ministered uponBy fiends; avenging such a nameless wrongAs turns black parricide to piety;Whilst we for basest ends . . . I fear, Orsino,While I consider all your words and looks,Comparing them with your proposal now,That you must be a villain. For what endCould you engage in such a perilous crime,Training me on with hints, and signs, and smiles,Even to this gulf? Thou art no liar? No,Thou art a lie! Traitor and murderer!Coward and slave! But, no, defend thyself; [Drawing.Let the sword speak what the indignant tongueDisdains to brand thee with.Orsino.Put up your weapon.Is it the desperation of your fearMakes you thus rash and sudden with a friend,Now ruined for your sake? If honest angerHave moved you, know, that what I just proposedWas but to try you. As for me, I think,Thankless affection led me to this point,From which, if my firm temper could repent,I cannot now recede. Even whilst we speakThe ministers of justice wait below:They grant me these brief moments. Now if youHave any word of melancholy comfortTo speak to your pale wife, 'twere best to passOut at the postern, and avoid them so.Giacomo.O, generous friend! How canst thou pardon me?Would that my life could purchase thine!Orsino.That wishNow comes a day too late. Haste; fare thee well!Hear'st thou not steps along the corridor? [Exit Giacomo.I'm sorry for it; but the guards are waitingAt his own gate, and such was my contrivanceThat I might rid me both of him and them.I thought to act a solemn comedyUpon the painted scene of this new world,And to attain my own peculiar endsBy some such plot of mingled good and illAs others weave; but there arose a PowerWhich grasped and snapped the threads of my deviceAnd turned it to a net of ruin . . . Ha! [A shout is heard.Is that my name I hear proclaimed abroad?But I will pass, wrapped in a vile disguise;Rags on my back, and a false innocenceUpon my face, through the misdeeming crowdWhich judges by what seems. 'Tis easy thenFor a new name and for a country new,And a new life, fashioned on old desires,To change the honours of abandoned Rome.And these must be the masks of that within,Which must remain unaltered . . . Oh, I fearThat what is past will never let me rest!Why, when none else is conscious, but myself,Of my misdeeds, should my own heart's contemptTrouble me? Have I not the power to flyMy own reproaches? Shall I be the slaveOf . . . what? A word? which those of this false worldEmploy against each other, not themselves;As men wear daggers not for self-offence.But if I am mistaken, where shall IFind the disguise to hide me from myself,As now I skulk from every other eye?[Exit.Scene II.-A Hall of Justice. Camillo, Judges, &c., are discovered seated; Marzio is led in.First Judge.Accused, do you persist in your denial?I ask you, are you innocent, or guilty?I demand who were the participatorsIn your offence? Speak truth and the whole truth.Marzio.My God! I did not kill him; I know nothing;Olimpio sold the robe to me from whichYou would infer my guilt.Second Judge.Away with him!First Judge.Dare you, with lips yet white from the rack's kissSpeak false? Is it so soft a questioner,That you would bandy lover's talk with itTill it wind out your life and soul? Away!Marzio.Spare me! O, spare! I will confess.First Judge.Then speak.Marzio.I strangled him in his sleep.First Judge.Who urged you to it?Marzio.His own son Giacomo, and the young prelateOrsino sent me to Petrella; thereThe ladies Beatrice and LucretiaTempted me with a thousand crowns, and IAnd my companion forthwith murdered him.Now let me die.First Judge.This sounds as bad as truth. Guards, there,Lead forth the prisoner!Enter Lucretia, Beatrice, and Giacomo, guarded.Look upon this man;When did you see him last?Beatrice.We never saw him.Marzio.You know me too well, Lady Beatrice.Beatrice.I know thee! How? where? when?Marzio.You know 'twas IWhom you did urge with menaces and bribesTo kill your father. When the thing was doneYou clothed me in a robe of woven goldAnd bade me thrive: how I have thriven, you see.You, my Lord Giacomo, Lady Lucretia,You know that what I speak is true.[Beatrice advances towards him; he covers his face, and shrinks back.Oh, dartThe terrible resentment of those eyesOn the dead earth! Turn them away from me!They wound: 'twas torture forced the truth. My Lords,Having said this let me be led to death.Beatrice.Poor wretch, I pity thee: yet stay awhile.Camillo.Guards, lead him not away.Beatrice.Cardinal Camillo,You have a good repute for gentlenessAnd wisdom: can it be that you sit hereTo countenance a wicked farce like this?When some obscure and trembling slave is draggedFrom sufferings which might shake the sternest heartAnd bade to answer, not as he believes,But as those may suspect or do desireWhose questions thence suggest their own reply:And that in peril of such hideous tormentsAs merciful God spares even the damned. Speak nowThe thing you surely know, which is that you,If your fine frame were stretched upon that wheel,And you were told: 'Confess that you did poisonYour little nephew; that fair blue-eyed childWho was the lodestar of your life:'-and thoughAll see, since his most swift and piteous death,That day and night, and heaven and earth, and time,And all the things hoped for or done thereinAre changed to you, through your exceeding grief,Yet you would say, 'I confess anything:'And beg from your tormentors, like that slave,The refuge of dishonourable death.I pray thee, Cardinal, that thou assertMy innocence.Camillo.(much moved).What shall we think, my Lords?Shame on these tears! I thought the heart was frozenWhich is their fountain. I would pledge my soulThat she is guiltless.Judge.Yet she must be tortured.Camillo.I would as soon have tortured mine own nephew(If he now lived he would be just her age;His hair, too, was her colour, and his eyesLike hers in shape, but blue and not so deep)As that most perfect image of God's loveThat ever came sorrowing upon the earth.She is as pure as speechless infancy!Judge.Well, be her purity on your head, my Lord,If you forbid the rack. His HolinessEnjoined us to pursue this monstrous crimeBy the severest forms of law; nay evenTo stretch a point against the criminals.The prisoners stand accused of parricideUpon such evidence as justifiesTorture.Beatrice.What evidence? This man's?Judge.Even so.Beatrice(to Marzio).Come near. And who art thou thus chosen forthOut of the multitude of living menTo kill the innocent?Marzio.I am Marzio,Thy father's vassal.Beatrice.Fix thine eyes on mine;Answer to what I ask.[Turning to the Judges.I prithee markHis countenance: unlike bold calumnyWhich sometimes dares not speak the thing it looks,He dares not look the thing he speaks, but bendsHis gaze on the blind earth.(To Marzio.)What! wilt thou sayThat I did murder my own father?Marzio.Oh!Spare me! My brain swims round . . . I cannot speak . . .It was that horrid torture forced the truth.Take me away! Let her not look on me!I am a guilty miserable wretch;I have said all I know; now, let me die!Beatrice.My Lords, if by my nature I had beenSo stern, as to have planned the crime alleged,Which your suspicions dictate to this slave,And the rack makes him utter, do you thinkI should have left this two-edged instrumentOf my misdeed; this man, this bloody knifeWith my own name engraven on the heft,Lying unsheathed amid a world of foes,For my own death? That with such horrible needFor deepest silence, I should have neglectedSo trivial a precaution, as the makingHis tomb the keeper of a secret writtenOn a thief's memory? What is his poor life?What are a thousand lives? A parricideHad trampled them like dust; and, see, he lives! (Turning to Marzio.)And thou . . .Marzio.Oh, spare me! Speak to me no more!That stern yet piteous look, those solemn tones, Wound worse than torture.(To the Judges.I have told it all;For pity's sake lead me away to death.Camillo.Guards, lead him nearer the Lady Beatrice,He shrinks from her regard like autumn's leafFrom the keen breath of the serenest north.Beatrice.O thou who tremblest on the giddy vergeOf life and death, pause ere thou answerest me;So mayst thou answer God with less dismay:What evil have we done thee? I, alas!Have lived but on this earth a few sad years,And so my lot was ordered, that a fatherFirst turned the moments of awakening lifeTo drops, each poisoning youth's sweet hope; and thenStabbed with one blow my everlasting soul;And my untainted fame; and even that peaceWhich sleeps within the core of the heart's heart;But the wound was not mortal; so my hateBecame the only worship I could liftTo our great father, who in pity and love,Armed thee, as thou dost say, to cut him off;And thus his wrong becomes my accusation;And art thou the accuser? If thou hopestMercy in heaven, show justice upon earth:Worse than a bloody hand is a hard heart.If thou hast done murders, made thy life's pathOver the trampled laws of God and man,Rush not before thy Judge, and say: 'My maker,I have done this and more; for there was oneWho was most pure and innocent on earth;And because she endured what never anyGuilty or innocent endured before:Because her wrongs could not be told, not thought;Because thy hand at length did rescue her;I with my words killed her and all her kin.'Think, I adjure you, what it is to slayThe reverence living in the minds of menTowards our ancient house, and stainless fame!Think what it is to strangle infant pity,Cradled in the belief of guileless looks,Till it become a crime to suffer. ThinkWhat 'tis to blot with infamy and bloodAll that which shows like innocence, and is,Hear me, great God! I swear, most innocent,So that the world lose all discriminationBetween the sly, fierce, wild regard of guilt,And that which now compels thee to replyTo what I ask: Am I, or am I notA parricide?Marzio.Thou art not!Judge.What is this?Marzio.I here declare those whom I did accuseAre innocent. 'Tis I alone am guilty.Judge.Drag him away to torments; let them beSubtle and long drawn out, to tear the foldsOf the heart's inmost cell. Unbind him notTill he confess.Marzio.Torture me as ye will:A keener pang has wrung a higher truthFrom my last breath. She is most innocent!Bloodhounds, not men, glut yourselves well with me;I will not give you that fine piece of natureTo rend and ruin.[Exit Marzio, guarded.Camillo.What say ye now, my Lords?Judge.Let tortures strain the truth till it be whiteAs snow thrice sifted by the frozen wind.Camillo.Yet stained with blood.Judge(to Beatrice).Know you this paper, Lady?Beatrice.Entrap me not with questions. Who stands hereAs my accuser? Ha! wilt thou be he,Who art my judge? Accuser, witness, judge,What, all in one? Here is Orsino's name;Where is Orsino? Let his eye meet mine.What means this scrawl? Alas! ye know not what,And therefore on the chance that it may beSome evil, will ye kill us?Enter an Officer.Officer.Marzio's dead.Judge.What did he say?Officer.Nothing. As soon as weHad bound him on the wheel, he smiled on us,As one who baffles a deep adversary;And holding his breath, died.Judge.There remains nothingBut to apply the question to those prisoners,Who yet remain stubborn.Camillo.I overruleFurther proceedings, and in the behalfOf these most innocent and noble personsWill use my interest with the Holy Father.Judge.Let the Pope's pleasure then be done. MeanwhileConduct these culprits each to separate cells;And be the engines ready: for this nightIf the Pope's resolution be as grave,Pious, and just as once, I'll wring the truthOut of those nerves and sinews, groan by groan.[Exeunt.Scene III.-The Cell of a Prison. Beatrice is discovered asleep on a couch. Enter Bernardo.Bernardo.How gently slumber rests upon her face,Like the last thoughts of some day sweetly spentClosing in night and dreams, and so prolonged.After such torments as she bore last night,How light and soft her breathing comes. Ay me!Methinks that I shall never sleep again.But I must shake the heavenly dew of restFrom this sweet folded flower, thus . . . wake! awake!What, sister, canst thou sleep?Beatrice(awaking).I was just dreamingThat we were all in Paradise. Thou knowestThis cell seems like a kind of ParadiseAfter our father's presence.Bernardo.Dear, dear sister,Would that thy dream were not a dream! O God!How shall I tell?Beatrice.What wouldst thou tell, sweet brother?Bernardo.Look not so calm and happy, or even whilstI stand considering what I have to sayMy heart will break.Beatrice.See now, thou mak'st me weep:How very friendless thou wouldst be, dear child,If I were dead. Say what thou hast to say.Bernardo.They have confessed; they could endure no moreThe tortures . . .Beatrice.Ha! What was there to confess?They must have told some weak and wicked lieTo flatter their tormentors. Have they saidThat they were guilty?

What!Will you give up these bodies to be draggedAt horses' heels, so that our hair should sweepThe footsteps of the vain and senseless crowd,Who, that they may make our calamityTheir worship and their spectacle, will leaveThe churches and the theatres as voidAs their own hearts? Shall the light multitudeFling, at their choice, curses or faded pity,Sad funeral flowers to deck a living corpse,Upon us as we pass to pass away,And leave . . . what memory of our having been?Infamy, blood, terror, despair? O thou,Who wert a mother to the parentless,Kill not thy child! Let not her wrongs kill thee!Brother, lie down with me upon the rack,And let us each be silent as a corpse;It soon will be as soft as any grave.'Tis but the falsehood it can wring from fearMakes the rack cruel.Giacomo.They will tear the truthEven from thee at last, those cruel pains:For pity's sake say thou art guilty now.Lucretia.Oh, speak the truth! Let us all quickly die;And after death, God is our judge, not they;He will have mercy on us.Bernardo.If indeedIt can be true, say so, dear sister mine;And then the Pope will surely pardon you,And all be well.Judge.Confess, or I will warpYour limbs with such keen tortures . . .Beatrice.Tortures! TurnThe rack henceforth into a spinning-wheel!Torture your dog, that he may tell when lastHe lapped the blood his master shed . . . not me!My pangs are of the mind, and of the heart,And of the soul; ay, of the inmost soul,Which weeps within tears as of burning gallTo see, in this ill world where none are true,My kindred false to their deserted selves.And with considering all the wretched lifeWhich I have lived, and its now wretched end,And the small justice shown by Heaven and EarthTo me or mine; and what a tyrant thou art,And what slaves these; and what a world we make,The oppressor and the oppressed . . . such pangs compelMy answer. What is it thou wouldst with me?Judge.Art thou not guilty of thy father's death?Beatrice.Or wilt thou rather tax high-judging GodThat He permitted such an act as thatWhich I have suffered, and which He beheld;Made it unutterable, and took from itAll refuge, all revenge, all consequence,But that which thou hast called my father's death?Which is or is not what men call a crime,Which either I have done, or have not done;Say what ye will. I shall deny no more.If ye desire it thus, thus let it be,And so an end of all. Now do your will;No other pains shall force another word.Judge.She is convicted, but has not confessed.Be it enough. Until their final sentenceLet none have converse with them. You, young Lord,Linger not here!Beatrice.Oh, tear him not away!Judge.Guards, do your duty.Bernardo(embracing Beatrice).Oh! would ye divideBody from soul?Officer.That is the headsman's business.[Exeunt all but Lucretia, Beatrice, and Giacomo.Giacomo.Have I confessed? Is it all over now?No hope! No refuge! O weak, wicked tongueWhich hast destroyed me, would that thou hadst beenCut out and thrown to dogs first! To have killedMy father first, and then betrayed my sister;Ay, thee! the one thing innocent and pureIn this black guilty world, to that which ISo well deserve!

Why did I not sustainThose torments? Oh, that I were all dissolvedInto these fast and unavailing tears,Which flow and feel not!Beatrice.What 'twas weak to do,'Tis weaker to lament, once being done;Take cheer! The God who knew my wrong, and madeOur speedy act the angel of His wrath,Seems, and but seems, to have abandoned us.Let us not think that we shall die for this.Brother, sit near me; give me your firm hand,You had a manly heart. Bear up! Bear up!O dearest Lady, put your gentle headUpon my lap, and try to sleep awhile:Your eyes look pale, hollow and overworn,With heaviness of watching and slow grief.Come, I will sing you some low, sleepy tune,Not cheerful, nor yet sad; some dull old thing,Some outworn and unused monotony,Such as our country gossips sing and spin,Till they almost forget they live: lie down!So, that will do. Have I forgot the words?Faith! They are sadder than I thought they were. SONGFalse friend, wilt thou smile or weepWhen my life is laid asleep?Little cares for a smile or a tear,The clay-cold corpse upon the bier!Farewell! Heigho!What is this whispers low?There is a snake in thy smile, my dear;And bitter poison within thy tear.Sweet sleep, were death like to thee,Or if thou couldst mortal be,I would close these eyes of pain;When to wake? Never again.O World! Farewell!Listen to the passing bell!It says, thou and I must part,With a light and a heavy heart.[The scene closes.Scene IV.-A Hall of the Prison. Enter Camillo and Bernardo.Camillo.The Pope is stern; not to be moved or bent.He looked as calm and keen as is the engineWhich tortures and which kills, exempt itselfFrom aught that it inflicts; a marble form,A rite, a law, a custom: not a man.He frowned, as if to frown had been the trickOf his machinery, on the advocatesPresenting the defences, which he toreAnd threw behind, muttering with hoarse, harsh voice:'Which among ye defended their old fatherKilled in his sleep?' Then to another: 'ThouDost this in virtue of thy place; 'tis well.'He turned to me then, looking deprecation,And said these three words, coldly: 'They must die.'Bernardo.And yet you left him not?Camillo.I urged him still;Pleading, as I could guess, the devilish wrongWhich prompted your unnatural parent's death.And he replied: 'Paolo Santa CroceMurdered his mother yester evening,And he is fled. Parricide grows so rifeThat soon, for some just cause no doubt, the youngWill strangle us all, dozing in our chairs.Authority, and power, and hoary hairAre grown crimes capital. You are my nephew,You come to ask their pardon; stay a moment;Here is their sentence; never see me moreTill, to the letter, it be all fulfilled.'Bernardo.O God, not so! I did believe indeedThat all you said was but sad preparationFor happy news. Oh, there are words and looksTo bend the sternest purpose! Once I knew them,Now I forget them at my dearest need.What think you if I seek him out, and batheHis feet and robe with hot and bitter tears?Importune him with prayers, vexing his brainWith my perpetual cries, until in rageHe strike me with his pastoral cross, and trampleUpon my prostrate head, so that my bloodMay stain the senseless dust on which he treads,And remorse waken mercy? I will do it!Oh, wait till I return![Rushes out.Camillo.Alas! poor boy!A wreck-devoted seaman thus might prayTo the deaf sea.Enter Lucretia, Beatrice, and Giacomo, guarded.Beatrice.I hardly dare to fearThat thou bring'st other news than a just pardon.Camillo.May God in heaven be less inexorableTo the Pope's prayers, than he has been to mine.Here is the sentence and the warrant.Beatrice(wildly).OMy God! Can it be possible I haveTo die so suddenly? So young to goUnder the obscure, cold, rotting, wormy ground!To be nailed down into a narrow place;To see no more sweet sunshine; hear no moreBlithe voice of living thing; muse not againUpon familiar thoughts, sad, yet thus lost-How fearful! to be nothing! Or to be . . .What? Oh, where am I? Let me not go mad!Sweet Heaven, forgive weak thoughts! If there should beNo God, no Heaven, no Earth in the void world;The wide, gray, lampless, deep, unpeopled world!If all things then should be . . . my father's spirit,His eye, his voice, his touch surrounding me;The atmosphere and breath of my dead life!If sometimes, as a shape more like himself,Even the form which tortured me on earth,Masked in gray hairs and wrinkles, he should comeAnd wind me in his hellish arms, and fixHis eyes on mine, and drag me down, down, down!For was he not alone omnipotentOn Earth, and ever present? Even though dead,Does not his spirit live in all that breathe,And work for me and mine still the same ruin,Scorn, pain, despair? Who ever yet returnedTo teach the laws of Death's untrodden realm?Unjust perhaps as those which drive us now,Oh, whither, whither?Lucretia.Trust in God's sweet love,The tender promises of Christ: ere night,Think, we shall be in Paradise.Beatrice.'Tis past!Whatever comes my heart shall sink no more.And yet, I know not why, your words strike chill:How tedious, false and cold seem all things. IHave met with much injustice in this world;No difference has been made by God or man,Or any power moulding my wretched lot,'Twixt good or evil, as regarded me.I am cut off from the only world I know,From light, and life, and love, in youth's sweet prime.You do well telling me to trust in God,I hope I do trust in Him. In whom elseCan any trust? And yet my heart is cold.[During the latter speeches Giacomo has retired conversing with Camillo, who now goes out; Giacomo advances.Giacomo.Know you not, Mother . . . Sister, know you not?Bernardo even now is gone to imploreThe Pope to grant our pardon.Lucretia.Child, perhapsIt will be granted. We may all then liveTo make these woes a tale for distant years:Oh, what a thought! It gushes to my heartLike the warm blood.Beatrice.Yet both will soon be cold.Oh, trample out that thought! Worse than despair,Worse than the bitterness of death, is hope:It is the only ill which can find placeUpon the giddy, sharp and narrow hourTottering beneath us. Plead with the swift frostThat it should spare the eldest flower of spring:Plead with awakening earthquake, o'er whose couchEven now a city stands, strong, fair, and free;Now stench and blackness yawn, like death. Oh, pleadWith famine, or wind-walking Pestilence,Blind lightning, or the deaf sea, not with man!Cruel, cold, formal man; righteous in words,In deeds a Cain. No, Mother, we must die:Since such is the reward of innocent lives;Such the alleviation of worst wrongs.And whilst our murderers live, and hard, cold men,Smiling and slow, walk through a world of tearsTo death as to life's sleep; 'twere just the graveWere some strange joy for us. Come, obscure Death,And wind me in thine all-embracing arms!Like a fond mother hide me in thy bosom,And rock me to the sleep from which none wake.Live ye, who live, subject to one anotherAs we were once, who now . . .Bernardo rushes in.Bernardo.Oh, horrible!That tears, that looks, that hope poured forth in prayer,Even till the heart is vacant and despairs,Should all be vain! The ministers of deathAre waiting round the doors. I thought I sawBlood on the face of one . . . What if 'twere fancy?Soon the heart's blood of all I love on earthWill sprinkle him, and he will wipe it offAs if 'twere only rain. O life! O world!Cover me! let me be no more! To seeThat perfect mirror of pure innocenceWherein I gazed, and grew happy and good,Shivered to dust! To see thee, Beatrice,Who made all lovely thou didst look upon . . .Thee, light of life . . . dead, dark! while I say, sister,To hear I have no sister; and thou, Mother,Whose love was as a bond to all our loves . . .Dead! The sweet bond broken!Enter Camillo and Guards.They come! Let meKiss those warm lips before their crimson leavesAre blighted . . . white . . . cold. Say farewell, beforeDeath chokes that gentle voice! Oh, let me hearYou speak!Beatrice.Farewell, my tender brother. ThinkOf our sad fate with gentleness, as now:And let mild, pitying thoughts lighten for theeThy sorrow's load. Err not in harsh despair,But tears and patience. One thing more, my child:For thine own sake be constant to the loveThou bearest us; and to the faith that I,Though wrapped in a strange cloud of crime and shame,Lived ever holy and unstained. And thoughIll tongues shall wound me, and our common nameBe as a mark stamped on thine innocent browFor men to point at as they pass, do thouForbear, and never think a thought unkindOf those, who perhaps love thee in their graves.So mayest thou die as I do; fear and painBeing subdued. Farewell! Farewell! Farewell!Bernardo.I cannot say, farewell!Camillo.Oh, Lady Beatrice!Beatrice.Give yourself no unnecessary pain,My dear Lord Cardinal. Here, Mother, tieMy girdle for me, and bind up this hairIn any simple knot; ay, that does well.And yours I see is coming down. How oftenHave we done this for one another; nowWe shall not do it any more. My Lord,We are quite ready. Well, 'tis very well.THE END                                            "
Queen Mab: Part Vii.,"                        Spirit'I was an infant when my mother wentTo see an atheist burned. She took me there.The dark-robed priests were met around the pile;The multitude was gazing silently;And as the culprit passed with dauntless mien,Tempered disdain in his unaltering eye,Mixed with a quiet smile, shone calmly forth;The thirsty fire crept round his manly limbs;His resolute eyes were scorched to blindness soon;His death-pang rent my heart! the insensate mob Uttered a cry of triumph, and I wept.'Weep not, child!' cried my mother, 'for that manHas said, There is no God.''FAIRY'There is no God!Nature confirms the faith his death-groan sealed.Let heaven and earth, let man's revolving race,His ceaseless generations, tell their tale;Let every part depending on the chainThat links it to the whole, point to the handThat grasps its term! Let every seed that fallsIn silent eloquence unfold its store Of argument; infinity within,Infinity without, belie creation;The exterminable spirit it containsIs Nature's only God; but human prideIs skilful to invent most serious namesTo hide its ignorance.'The name of GodHas fenced about all crime with holiness,Himself the creature of his worshippers,Whose names and attributes and passions change,Seeva, Buddh, Foh, Jehovah, God, or Lord, Even with the human dupes who build his shrines,Still serving o'er the war-polluted worldFor desolation's watchword; whether hostsStain his death-blushing chariot-wheels, as onTriumphantly they roll, whilst Brahmins raiseA sacred hymn to mingle with the groans;Or countless partners of his power divideHis tyranny to weakness; or the smokeOf burning towns, the cries of female helplessness,Unarmed old age, and youth, and infancy,Horribly massacred, ascend to heavenIn honor of his name; or, last and worst,Earth groans beneath religion's iron age,And priests dare babble of a God of peace,Even whilst their hands are red with guiltless blood,Murdering the while, uprooting every germOf truth, exterminating, spoiling all,Making the earth a slaughter-house!'O Spirit! through the senseBy which thy inner nature was apprisedOf outward shows, vague dreams have rolled,And varied reminiscences have wakedTablets that never fade;All things have been imprinted there,The stars, the sea, the earth, the sky,Even the unshapeliest lineamentsOf wild and fleeting visionsHave left a record thereTo testify of earth.'These are my empire, for to me is given The wonders of the human world to keep,And fancy's thin creations to endowWith manner, being and reality;Therefore a wondrous phantom from the dreamsOf human error's dense and purblind faithI will evoke, to meet thy questioning.Ahasuerus, rise!'A strange and woe-worn wightArose beside the battlement,And stood unmoving there.His inessential figure cast no shadeUpon the golden floor;His port and mien bore mark of many years,And chronicles of untold ancientnessWere legible within his beamless eye;Yet his cheek bore the mark of youth;Freshness and vigor knit his manly frame;The wisdom of old age was mingled thereWith youth's primeval dauntlessness;And inexpressible woe,Chastened by fearless resignation, gaveAn awful grace to his all-speaking brow.SPIRIT'Is there a God?'AHASUERUS'Is there a God!-ay, an almighty God,And vengeful as almighty! Once his voiceWas heard on earth; earth shuddered at the sound;The fiery-visaged firmament expressedAbhorrence, and the grave of Nature yawnedTo swallow all the dauntless and the goodThat dared to hurl defiance at his throne, Girt as it was with power. None but slavesSurvived,-cold-blooded slaves, who did the workOf tyrannous omnipotence; whose soulsNo honest indignation ever urgedTo elevated daring, to one deedWhich gross and sensual self did not pollute.These slaves built temples for the omnipotent fiend,Gorgeous and vast; the costly altars smokedWith human blood, and hideous pÃ¦ans rungThrough all the long-drawn aisles. A murderer heardHis voice in Egypt, one whose gifts and artsHad raised him to his eminence in power,Accomplice of omnipotence in crimeAnd confidant of the all-knowing one.These were Jehovah's words.''From an eternity of idlenessI, God, awoke; in seven days' toil made earthFrom nothing; rested, and created man;I placed him in a paradise, and therePlanted the tree of evil, so that he Might eat and perish, and my soul procureWherewith to sate its malice and to turn,Even like a heartless conqueror of the earth,All misery to my fame. The race of men,Chosen to my honor, with impunityMay sate the lusts I planted in their heart.Here I command thee hence to lead them on,Until with hardened feet their conquering troopsWade on the promised soil through woman's blood,And make my name be dreaded through the land.Yet ever-burning flame and ceaseless woeShall be the doom of their eternal souls,With every soul on this ungrateful earth,Virtuous or vicious, weak or strong,-even allShall perish, to fulfil the blind revenge(Which you, to men, call justice) of their God.''The murderer's browQuivered with horror.''God omnipotent,Is there no mercy? must our punishmentBe endless? will long ages roll away, And see no term? Oh! wherefore hast thou madeIn mockery and wrath this evil earth?Mercy becomes the powerful-be but just!O God! repent and save!'''One way remains:I will beget a son and he shall bearThe sins of all the world; he shall ariseIn an unnoticed corner of the earth,And there shall die upon a cross, and purgeThe universal crime; so that the fewOn whom my grace descends, those who are marked As vessels to the honor of their God,May credit this strange sacrifice and saveTheir souls alive. Millions shall live and die,Who ne'er shall call upon their Saviour's name,But, unredeemed, go to the gaping grave,Thousands shall deem it an old woman's tale,Such as the nurses frighten babes withal;These in a gulf of anguish and of flameShall curse their reprobation endlessly,Yet tenfold pangs shall force them to avow, Even on their beds of torment where they howl,My honor and the justice of their doom.What then avail their virtuous deeds, their thoughtsOf purity, with radiant genius brightOr lit with human reason's earthly ray?Many are called, but few will I elect.Do thou my bidding, Moses!''Even the murderer's cheekWas blanched with horror, and his quivering lipsScarce faintly uttered-'O almighty one,I tremble and obey!' 'O Spirit! centuries have set their sealOn this heart of many wounds, and loaded brain,Since the Incarnate came; humbly he came,Veiling his horrible Godhead in the shapeOf man, scorned by the world, his name unheardSave by the rabble of his native town,Even as a parish demagogue. He ledThe crowd; he taught them justice, truth and peace,In semblance; but he lit within their soulsThe quenchless flames of zeal, and blessed the sword He brought on earth to satiate with the bloodOf truth and freedom his malignant soulAt length his mortal frame was led to death.I stood beside him; on the torturing crossNo pain assailed his unterrestrial sense;And yet he groaned. Indignantly I summedThe massacres and miseries which his nameHad sanctioned in my country, and I cried,'Go! go!' in mockery.A smile of godlike malice reilluminedHis fading lineaments. 'I go,' he cried,'But thou shalt wander o'er the unquiet earthEternally.' The dampness of the graveBathed my imperishable front. I fell,And long lay tranced upon the charmÃ¨d soil.When I awoke hell burned within my brainWhich staggered on its seat; for all aroundThe mouldering relics of my kindred lay,Even as the Almighty's ire arrested them,And in their various attitudes of death My murdered children's mute and eyeless skullsGlared ghastily upon me.But my soul,From sight and sense of the polluting woeOf tyranny, had long learned to preferHell's freedom to the servitude of heaven.Therefore I rose, and dauntlessly beganMy lonely and unending pilgrimage,Resolved to wage unweariable warWith my almighty tyrant and to hurlDefiance at his impotence to harm Beyond the curse I bore. The very hand,That barred my passage to the peaceful grave,Has crushed the earth to misery, and givenIts empire to the chosen of his slaves.These I have seen, even from the earliest dawnOf weak, unstable and precarious power,Then preaching peace, as now they practise war;So, when they turned but from the massacreOf unoffending infidels to quenchTheir thirst for ruin in the very blood That flowed in their own veins, and pitiless zealFroze every human feeling as the wifeSheathed in her husband's heart the sacred steel,Even whilst its hopes were dreaming of her love;And friends to friends, brothers to brothers stoodOpposed in bloodiest battle-field, and war,Scarce satiable by fate's last death-draught, waged,Drunk from the wine-press of the Almighty's wrath;Whilst the red cross, in mockery of peace,Pointed to victory! When the fray was done, No remnant of the exterminated faithSurvived to tell its ruin, but the flesh,With putrid smoke poisoning the atmosphere,That rotted on the half-extinguished pile.'Yes! I have seen God's worshippers unsheatheThe sword of his revenge, when grace descended,Confirming all unnatural impulses,To sanctify their desolating deeds;And frantic priests waved the ill-omened crossO'er the unhappy earth; then shone the sunOn showers of gore from the upflashing steelOf safe assassination, and all crimeMade stingless by the spirits of the Lord,And blood-red rainbows canopied the land.'Spirit! no year of my eventful beingHas passed unstained by crime and misery,Which flows from God's own faith. I 've marked his slavesWith tongues, whose lies are venomous, beguileThe insensate mob, and, whilst one hand was redWith murder, feign to stretch the other out For brotherhood and peace; and that they nowBabble of love and mercy, whilst their deedsAre marked with all the narrowness and crimeThat freedom's young arm dare not yet chastise,Reason may claim our gratitude, who now,Establishing the imperishable throneOf truth and stubborn virtue, maketh vainThe unprevailing malice of my foe,Whose bootless rage heaps torments for the brave,Adds impotent eternities to pain, Whilst keenest disappointment racks his breastTo see the smiles of peace around them play,To frustrate or to sanctify their doom.'Thus have I stood,-through a wild waste of yearsStruggling with whirlwinds of mad agony,Yet peaceful, and serene, and self-enshrined,Mocking my powerless tyrant's horrible curseWith stubborn and unalterable will,Even as a giant oak, which heaven's fierce flameHad scathÃ¨d in the wilderness, to stand A monument of fadeless ruin there;Yet peacefully and movelessly it bravesThe midnight conflict of the wintry storm,As in the sunlight's calm it spreadsIts worn and withered arms on highTo meet the quiet of a summer's noon.'The Fairy waved her wand;Ahasuerus fledFast as the shapes of mingled shade and mist,That lurk in the glens of a twilight grove, Flee from the morning beam;-The matter of which dreams are madeNot more endowed with actual lifeThan this phantasmal portraitureOf wandering human thought.

Sister Rosa: A Ballad,"                        I.The death-bell beats!--The mountain repeatsThe echoing sound of the knell;And the dark Monk nowWraps the cowl round his brow,As he sits in his lonely cell.II.And the cold hand of deathChills his shuddering breath,As he lists to the fearful layWhich the ghosts of the sky,As they sweep wildly by,Sing to departed day.And they sing of the hourWhen the stern fates had powerTo resolve Rosa’s form to its clay.III.But that hour is past;And that hour was the lastOf peace to the dark Monk’s brain.Bitter tears, from his eyes, gushed silent and fast;And he strove to suppress them in vain. IV.Then his fair cross of gold he dashed on the floor,When the death-knell struck on his ear.--'Delight is in storeFor her evermore;But for me is fate, horror, and fear.'V.Then his eyes wildly rolled,When the death-bell tolled,And he raged in terrific woe.And he stamped on the ground,--But when ceased the sound,Tears again began to flow.VI.And the ice of despairChilled the wild throb of care,And he sate in mute agony still;Till the night-stars shone through the cloudless air,And the pale moonbeam slept on the hill.VII.Then he knelt in his cell:--And the horrors of hellWere delights to his agonized pain,And he prayed to God to dissolve the spell, Which else must for ever remain.VIII.And in fervent pray'r he knelt on the ground,Till the abbey bell struck One:His feverish blood ran chill at the sound:A voice hollow and horrible murmured around--'The term of thy penance is done!'IX.Grew dark the night;The moonbeam brightWaxed faint on the mountain high;And, from the black hill, Went a voice cold and still,--'Monk! thou art free to die.'X.Then he rose on his feet,And his heart loud did beat,And his limbs they were palsied with dread; Whilst the grave's clammy dewO'er his pale forehead grew;And he shuddered to sleep with the dead.XI.And the wild midnight stormRaved around his tall form, As he sought the chapel's gloom:And the sunk grass did sighTo the wind, bleak and high,As he searched for the new-made tomb.XII.And forms, dark and high, Seemed around him to fly,And mingle their yells with the blast:And on the dark wallHalf-seen shadows did fall,As enhorrored he onward passed.XIII.And the storm-fiends wild raveO’er the new-made grave,And dread shadows linger around.The Monk called on God his soul to save,And, in horror, sank on the ground. XIV.Then despair nerved his armTo dispel the charm,And he burst Rosa's coffin asunder.And the fierce storm did swellMore terrific and fell,And louder pealed the thunder.XV.And laughed, in joy, the fiendish throng,Mixed with ghosts of the mouldering dead:And their grisly wings, as they floated along,Whistled in murmurs dread.XVI.And her skeleton form the dead Nun rearedWhich dripped with the chill dew of hell.In her half-eaten eyeballs two pale flames appeared,And triumphant their gleam on the dark Monk glared,As he stood within the cell. XVII.And her lank hand lay on his shuddering brain;But each power was nerved by fear.--'I never, henceforth, may breathe again;Death now ends mine anguished pain.--The grave yawns,--we meet there.'XVIII.And her skeleton lungs did utter the sound,So deadly, so lone, and so fell,That in long vibrations shuddered the ground;And as the stern notes floated around,A deep groan was answered from hell.

Queen Mab: Part V.,"                        'Thus do the generations of the earthGo to the grave and issue from the womb,Surviving still the imperishable changeThat renovates the world; even as the leavesWhich the keen frost-wind of the waning yearHas scattered on the forest-soil and heapedFor many seasons there-though long they choke,Loading with loathsome rottenness the land,All germs of promise, yet when the tall treesFrom which they fell, shorn of their lovely shapes,Lie level with the earth to moulder there,They fertilize the land they long deformed;Till from the breathing lawn a forest springsOf youth, integrity and loveliness,Like that which gave it life, to spring and die.Thus suicidal selfishness, that blightsThe fairest feelings of the opening heart,Is destined to decay, whilst from the soilShall spring all virtue, all delight, all love,And judgment cease to wage unnatural warWith passion's unsubduable array.Twin-sister of Religion, Selfishness!Rival in crime and falsehood, aping allThe wanton horrors of her bloody play;Yet frozen, unimpassioned, spiritless,Shunning the light, and owning not its name,Compelled by its deformity to screenWith flimsy veil of justice and of rightIts unattractive lineaments that scareAll save the brood of ignorance; at onceThe cause and the effect of tyranny;Unblushing, hardened, sensual and vile;Dead to all love but of its abjectness;With heart impassive by more noble powersThan unshared pleasure, sordid gain, or fame;Despising its own miserable being,Which still it longs, yet fears, to disenthrall.'Hence commerce springs, the venal interchangeOf all that human art or Nature yield;Which wealth should purchase not, but want demand,And natural kindness hasten to supplyFrom the full fountain of its boundless love,Forever stifled, drained and tainted now.Commerce! beneath whose poison-breathing shadeNo solitary virtue dares to spring,But poverty and wealth with equal handScatter their withering curses, and unfoldThe doors of premature and violent deathTo pining famine and full-fed disease,To all that shares the lot of human life, Which, poisoned body and soul, scarce drags the chainThat lengthens as it goes and clanks behind.'Commerce has set the mark of selfishness,The signet of its all-enslaving power,Upon a shining ore, and called it gold;Before whose image bow the vulgar great,The vainly rich, the miserable proud,The mob of peasants, nobles, priests and kings,And with blind feelings reverence the powerThat grinds them to the dust of misery. But in the temple of their hireling heartsGold is a living god and rules in scornAll earthly things but virtue.'Since tyrants by the sale of human lifeHeap luxuries to their sensualism, and fameTo their wide-wasting and insatiate pride,Success has sanctioned to a credulous worldThe ruin, the disgrace, the woe of war.His hosts of blind and unresisting dupesThe despot numbers; from his cabinet These puppets of his schemes he moves at will,Even as the slaves by force or famine driven,Beneath a vulgar master, to performA task of cold and brutal drudgery;-Hardened to hope, insensible to fear,Scarce living pulleys of a dead machine,Mere wheels of work and articles of trade,That grace the proud and noisy pomp of wealth!'The harmony and happiness of manYields to the wealth of nations; that which lifts His nature to the heaven of its pride,Is bartered for the poison of his soul;The weight that drags to earth his towering hopes,Blighting all prospect but of selfish gain,Withering all passion but of slavish fear,Extinguishing all free and generous loveOf enterprise and daring, even the pulseThat fancy kindles in the beating heartTo mingle with sensation, it destroys,-Leaves nothing but the sordid lust of self,The grovelling hope of interest and gold,Unqualified, unmingled, unredeemedEven by hypocrisy.And statesmen boastOf wealth! The wordy eloquence that livesAfter the ruin of their hearts, can gildThe bitter poison of a nation's woe;Can turn the worship of the servile mobTo their corrupt and glaring idol, fame,From virtue, trampled by its iron tread,-Although its dazzling pedestal be raised Amid the horrors of a limb-strewn field,With desolated dwellings smoking round.The man of ease, who, by his warm fireside,To deeds of charitable intercourseAnd bare fulfilment of the common lawsOf decency and prejudice confinesThe struggling nature of his human heart,Is duped by their cold sophistry; he shedsA passing tear perchance upon the wreckOf earthly peace, when near his dwelling's doorThe frightful waves are driven,-when his sonIs murdered by the tyrant, or religionDrives his wife raving mad.

'This commerce of sincerest virtue needsNo meditative signs of selfishness,No jealous intercourse of wretched gain,No balancings of prudence, cold and long;In just and equal measure all is weighed,One scale contains the sum of human weal,And one, the good man's heart.How vainly seekThe selfish for that happiness deniedTo aught but virtue! Blind and hardened, they,Who hope for peace amid the storms of care,Who covet power they know not how to use,And sigh for pleasure they refuse to give,-Madly they frustrate still their own designs;And, where they hope that quiet to enjoyWhich virtue pictures, bitterness of soul,Pining regrets, and vain repentances,Disease, disgust and lassitude pervadeTheir valueless and miserable lives.'But hoary-headed selfishness has feltIts death-blow and is tottering to the grave;A brighter morn awaits the human day,When every transfer of earth's natural giftsShall be a commerce of good words and works;When poverty and wealth, the thirst of fame,The fear of infamy, disease and woe,War with its million horrors, and fierce hell,Shall live but in the memory of time,Who, like a penitent libertine, shall start,Look back, and shudder at his younger years.'

O’er allIn every fane, her honours first ariseFrom men--the eldest of Divinities. These spirits she persuades not, nor deceives,But none beside escape, so well she weavesHer unseen toils; nor mortal men, nor godsWho live secure in their unseen abodes.She won the soul of him whose fierce delight Is thunder--first in glory and in might.And, as she willed, his mighty mind deceiving,With mortal limbs his deathless limbs inweaving,Concealed him from his spouse and sister fair,Whom to wise Saturn ancient Rhea bare.but in return,In Venus Jove did soft desire awaken,That by her own enchantments overtaken,She might, no more from human union free,Burn for a nursling of mortality.For once amid the assembled Deities,The laughter-loving Venus from her eyesShot forth the light of a soft starlight smile,And boasting said, that she, secure the while,Could bring at Will to the assembled GodsThe mortal tenants of earth’s dark abodes,And mortal offspring from a deathless stemShe could produce in scorn and spite of them.Therefore he poured desire into her breastOf young Anchises,Feeding his herds among the mossy fountainsOf the wide Ida’s many-folded mountains,--Whom Venus saw, and loved, and the love clungLike wasting fire her senses wild among.

Prince Athanase,"                        A FragmentPART IThere was a youth, who, as with toil and travel,Had grown quite weak and gray before his time;Nor any could the restless griefs unravelWhich burned within him, withering up his primeAnd goading him, like fiends, from land to land.Not his the load of any secret crime,For nought of ill his heart could understand,But pity and wild sorrow for the same;-Not his the thirst for glory or command,Baffled with blast of hope-consuming shame;Nor evil joys which fire the vulgar breast,And quench in speedy smoke its feeble flame,Had left within his soul their dark unrest:Nor what religion fables of the graveFeared he,-Philosophy's accepted guest.For none than he a purer heart could have,Or that loved good more for itself alone;Of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave.What sorrow, strange, and shadowy, and unknown,Sent him, a hopeless wanderer, through mankind?-If with a human sadness he did groan,He had a gentle yet aspiring mind;Just, innocent, with varied learning fed;And such a glorious consolation findIn others' joy, when all their own is dead:He loved, and laboured for his kind in grief,And yet, unlike all others, it is saidThat from such toil he never found relief.Although a child of fortune and of power,Of an ancestral name the orphan chief,His soul had wedded Wisdom, and her dowerIs love and justice, clothed in which he sateApart from men, as in a lonely tower,Pitying the tumult of their dark estate.-Yet even in youth did he not e'er abuseThe strength of wealth or thought, to consecrateThose false opinions which the harsh rich useTo blind the world they famish for their pride;Nor did he hold from any man his dues,But, like a steward in honest dealings tried,With those who toiled and wept, the poor and wise,His riches and his cares he did divide.Fearless he was, and scorning all disguise,What he dared do or think, though men might start,He spoke with mild yet unaverted eyes;Liberal he was of soul, and frank of heart,And to his many friends-all loved him well-Whate'er he knew or felt he would impart,If words he found those inmost thoughts to tell;If not, he smiled or wept; and his weak foesHe neither spurned nor hated-though with fellAnd mortal hate their thousand voices rose,They passed like aimless arrows from his ear-Nor did his heart or mind its portal closeTo those, or them, or any, whom life's sphereMay comprehend within its wide array.What sadness made that vernal spirit sere?-He knew not. Though his life, day after day,Was failing like an unreplenished stream,Though in his eyes a cloud and burthen lay,Through which his soul, like Vesper's serene beamPiercing the chasms of ever rising clouds,Shone, softly burning; though his lips did seemLike reeds which quiver in impetuous floods;And through his sleep, and o'er each waking hour,Thoughts after thoughts, unresting multitudes,Were driven within him by some secret power,Which bade them blaze, and live, and roll afar,Like lights and sounds, from haunted tower to towerO'er castled mountains borne, when tempest's warIs levied by the night-contending winds,And the pale dalesmen watch with eager ear;-Though such were in his spirit, as the fiendsWhich wake and feed an everliving woe,-What was this grief, which ne'er in other mindsA mirror found,-he knew not-none could know;But on whoe'er might question him he turnedThe light of his frank eyes, as if to showHe knew not of the grief within that burned,But asked forbearance with a mournful look;Or spoke in words from which none ever learnedThe cause of his disquietude; or shookWith spasms of silent passion; or turned pale:So that his friends soon rarely undertookTo stir his secret pain without avail;-For all who knew and loved him then perceivedThat there was drawn an adamantine veilBetween his heart and mind,-both unrelievedWrought in his brain and bosom separate strife.Some said that he was mad, others believedThat memories of an antenatal lifeMade this, where now he dwelt, a penal hell;And others said that such mysterious griefFrom God's displeasure, like a darkness, fellOn souls like his, which owned no higher lawThan love; love calm, steadfast, invincibleBy mortal fear or supernatural awe;And others,-''Tis the shadow of a dreamWhich the veiled eye of Memory never saw,'But through the soul's abyss, like some dark streamThrough shattered mines and caverns underground,Rolls, shaking its foundations; and no beam'Of joy may rise, but it is quenched and drownedIn the dim whirlpools of this dream obscure;Soon its exhausted waters will have found'A lair of rest beneath thy spirit pure,O Athanase!-in one so good and great,Evil or tumult cannot long endure.'So spake they: idly of another's stateBabbling vain words and fond philosophy;This was their consolation; such debateMen held with one another; nor did he,Like one who labours with a human woe,Decline this talk: as if its theme might beAnother, not himself, he to and froQuestioned and canvassed it with subtlest wit;And none but those who loved him best could knowThat which he knew not, how it galled and bitHis weary mind, this converse vain and cold;For like an eyeless nightmare grief did sitUpon his being; a snake which fold by foldPressed out the life of life, a clinging fiendWhich clenched him if he stirred with deadlier hold;-And so his grief remained-let it remain-untold.PART IIFRAGMENT IPrince Athanase had one belovèd friend,An old, old man, with hair of silver white,And lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blendWith his wise words; and eyes whose arrowy lightShone like the reflex of a thousand minds.He was the last whom superstition's blightHad spared in Greece-the blight that cramps and blinds,-And in his olive bower at OEnoeHad sate from earliest youth. Like one who findsA fertile island in the barren sea,One mariner who has survived his matesMany a drear month in a great ship-so heWith soul-sustaining songs, and sweet debatesOf ancient lore, there fed his lonely being:-'The mind becomes that which it contemplates,'-And thus Zonoras, by forever seeingTheir bright creations, grew like wisest men;And when he heard the crash of nations fleeingA bloodier power than ruled thy ruins then,O sacred Hellas! many weary yearsHe wandered, till the path of Laian's glenWas grass-grown-and the unremembered tearsWere dry in Laian for their honoured chief,Who fell in Byzant, pierced by Moslem spears:-And as the lady looked with faithful griefFrom her high lattice o'er the rugged path,Where she once saw that horseman toil, with briefAnd blighting hope, who with the news of deathStruck body and soul as with a mortal blight,She saw between the chestnuts, far beneath,An old man toiling up, a weary wight;And soon within her hospitable hallShe saw his white hairs glittering in the lightOf the wood fire, and round his shoulders fall;And his wan visage and his withered mien,Yet calm and gentle and majestical.And Athanase, her child, who must have beenThen three years old, sate opposite and gazedIn patient silence.FRAGMENT IISuch was Zonoras; and as daylight findsOne amaranth glittering on the path of frost,When autumn nights have nipped all weaker kinds,Thus through his age, dark, cold, and tempest-tossed,Shone truth upon Zonoras; and he filledFrom fountains pure, nigh overgrown and lost,The spirit of Prince Athanase, a child,With soul-sustaining songs of ancient loreAnd philosophic wisdom, clear and mild.And sweet and subtle talk they evermore,The pupil and the master, shared; until,Sharing that undiminishable store,The youth, as shadows on a grassy hillOutrun the winds that chase them, soon outranHis teacher, and did teach with native skillStrange truths and new to that experienced man;Still they were friends, as few have ever beenWho mark the extremes of life's discordant span.So in the caverns of the forest green,Or on the rocks of echoing ocean hoar,Zonoras and Prince Athanase were seenBy summer woodmen; and when winter's roarSounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war,The Balearic fisher, driven from shore,Hanging upon the peakèd wave afar,Then saw their lamp from Laian's turret gleam,Piercing the stormy darkness, like a starWhich pours beyond the sea one steadfast beam,Whilst all the constellations of the skySeemed reeling through the storm . . .

Letter To Maria Gisborne,"                        The spider spreads her webs, whether she beIn poet's tower, cellar, or barn, or tree;The silk-worm in the dark green mulberry leavesHis winding sheet and cradle ever weaves;So I, a thing whom moralists call worm,Sit spinning still round this decaying form,From the fine threads of rare and subtle thought-No net of words in garish colours wroughtTo catch the idle buzzers of the day-But a soft cell, where when that fades away,Memory may clothe in wings my living nameAnd feed it with the asphodels of fame,Which in those hearts which must remember meGrow, making love an immortality.Whoever should behold me now, I wist,Would think I were a mighty mechanist,Bent with sublime Archimedean artTo breathe a soul into the iron heartOf some machine portentous, or strange gin,Which by the force of figured spells might winIts way over the sea, and sport therein;For round the walls are hung dread engines, suchAs Vulcan never wrought for Jove to clutchIxion or the Titan:-or the quickWit of that man of God, St. Dominic,To convince Atheist, Turk, or Heretic,Or those in philanthropic council met,Who thought to pay some interest for the debtThey owed to Jesus Christ for their salvation,By giving a faint foretaste of damnationTo Shakespeare, Sidney, Spenser, and the restWho made our land an island of the blest,When lamp-like Spain, who now relumes her fireOn Freedom's hearth, grew dim with Empire:-With thumbscrews, wheels, with tooth and spike and jag,Which fishers found under the utmost cragOf Cornwall and the storm-encompassed isles,Where to the sky the rude sea rarely smilesUnless in treacherous wrath, as on the mornWhen the exulting elements in scorn,Satiated with destroyed destruction, laySleeping in beauty on their mangled prey,As panthers sleep;-and other strange and dreadMagical forms the brick floor overspread,-Proteus transformed to metal did not makeMore figures, or more strange; nor did he takeSuch shapes of unintelligible brass,Or heap himself in such a horrid massOf tin and iron not to be understood;And forms of unimaginable wood,To puzzle Tubal Cain and all his brood:Great screws, and cones, and wheels, and groovèd blocks,The elements of what will stand the shocksOf wave and wind and time.-Upon the tableMore knacks and quips there be than I am ableTo catalogize in this verse of mine:-A pretty bowl of wood-not full of wine,But quicksilver; that dew which the gnomes drinkWhen at their subterranean toil they swink,Pledging the demons of the earthquake, whoReply to them in lava-cry halloo!And call out to the cities o'er their head,-Roofs, towers, and shrines, the dying and the dead,Crash through the chinks of earth-and then all quaffAnother rouse, and hold their sides and laugh.This quicksilver no gnome has drunk-withinThe walnut bowl it lies, veinèd and thin,In colour like the wake of light that stainsThe Tuscan deep, when from the moist moon rainsThe inmost shower of its white fire-the breezeIs still-blue Heaven smiles over the pale seas.And in this bowl of quicksilver-for IYield to the impulse of an infancyOutlasting manhood-I have made to floatA rude idealism of a paper boat:-A hollow screw with cogs-Henry will knowThe thing I mean and laugh at me,-if soHe fears not I should do more mischief.-NextLie bills and calculations much perplexed,With steam-boats, frigates, and machinery quaintTraced over them in blue and yellow paint.Then comes a range of mathematicalInstruments, for plans nautical and statical;A heap of rosin, a queer broken glassWith ink in it;-a china cup that wasWhat it will never be again, I think,-A thing from which sweet lips were wont to drinkThe liquor doctors rail at-and which IWill quaff in spite of them-and when we dieWe'll toss up who died first of drinking tea,And cry out,-'Heads or tails?' where'er we be.Near that a dusty paint-box, some odd hooks,A half-burnt match, an ivory block, three books,Where conic sections, spherics, logarithms,To great Laplace, from Saunderson and Sims,Lie heaped in their harmonious disarrayOf figures,-disentangle them who may.Baron de Tott's Memoirs beside them lie,And some odd volumes of old chemistry.Near those a most inexplicable thing,With lead in the middle-I'm conjecturingHow to make Henry understand; but no-I'll leave, as Spenser says, with many mo,This secret in the pregnant womb of time,Too vast a matter for so weak a rhyme.And here like some weird Archimage sit I,Plotting dark spells, and devilish enginery,The self-impelling steam-wheels of the mindWhich pump up oaths from clergymen, and grindThe gentle spirit of our meek reviewsInto a powdery foam of salt abuse,Ruffling the ocean of their self-content;-I sit-and smile or sigh as is my bent,But not for them-Libeccio rushes roundWith an inconstant and an idle sound,I heed him more than them-the thunder-smokeIs gathering on the mountains, like a cloakFolded athwart their shoulders broad and bare;The ripe corn under the undulating airUndulates like an ocean;-and the vinesAre trembling wide in all their trellised lines-The murmur of the awakening sea doth fillThe empty pauses of the blast;-the hillLooks hoary through the white electric rain,And from the glens beyond, in sullen strain,The interrupted thunder howls;

and which foundAn echo in our hearts, and with the soundStartled oblivion;-thou wert then to meAs is a nurse-when inarticulatelyA child would talk as its grown parents do.If living winds the rapid clouds pursue,If hawks chase doves through the aethereal way,Huntsmen the innocent deer, and beasts their prey,Why should not we rouse with the spirit's blastOut of the forest of the pathless pastThese recollected pleasures?You are nowIn London, that great sea, whose ebb and flowAt once is deaf and loud, and on the shoreVomits its wrecks, and still howls on for more.Yet in its depth what treasures!

Saint Edmond's Eve,"                        Oh! did you observe the Black Canon pass,And did you observe his frown?He goeth to say the midnight mass,In holy St. Edmond's town.He goeth to sing the burial chaunt,And to lay the wandering sprite,Whose shadowy, restless form doth haunt,The Abbey's drear aisle this night.It saith it will not its wailing cease,'Till that holy man come near,'Till he pour o’er its grave the prayer of peace,And sprinkle the hallowed tear.The Canon's horse is stout and strongThe road is plain and fair,But the Canon slowly wends along,And his brow is gloomed with care.Who is it thus late at the Abbey-gate?Sullen echoes the portal bell,It sounds like the whispering voice of fate,It sounds like a funeral knell.The Canon his faltering knee thrice bowed,And his frame was convulsed with fear,When a voice was heard distinct and loud,'Prepare! for thy hour is near.'He crosses his breast, he mutters a prayer, To Heaven he lifts his eye,He heeds not the Abbot's gazing stare,Nor the dark Monks who murmured by.Bare-headed he worships the sculptured saintsThat frown on the sacred walls,His face it grows pale,--he trembles, he faints,At the Abbot’s feet he falls.And straight the father’s robe he kissed,Who cried, 'Grace dwells with thee,The spirit will fade like the morning mist, At your benedicite.'Now haste within! the board is spread,Keen blows the air, and cold,The spectre sleeps in its earthy bed,'Till St. Edmond’s bell hath tolled,--'Yet rest your wearied limbs to-night,You’ve journeyed many a mile,To-morrow lay the wailing sprite,That shrieks in the moonlight aisle.'Oh! faint are my limbs and my bosom is cold, Yet to-night must the sprite be laid,Yet to-night when the hour of horror's told,Must I meet the wandering shade.'Nor food, nor rest may now delay,--For hark! the echoing pile, A bell loud shakes!—Oh haste away,O lead to the haunted aisle.'The torches slowly move before,The cross is raised on high,A smile of peace the Canon wore,But horror dimmed his eye--And now they climb the footworn stair,The chapel gates unclose,Now each breathed low a fervent prayer,And fear each bosom froze--Now paused awhile the doubtful bandAnd viewed the solemn scene,--Full dark the clustered columns stand,The moon gleams pale between--'Say father, say, what cloisters' gloom Conceals the unquiet shade,Within what dark unhallowed tomb,The corse unblessed was laid.''Through yonder drear aisle alone it walks,And murmurs a mournful plaint, Of thee! Black Canon, it wildly talks,And call on thy patron saint--The pilgrim this night with wondering eyes,As he prayed at St. Edmond's shrine,From a black marble tomb hath seen it rise, And under yon arch recline.'--‘Oh! say upon that black marble tomb,What memorial sad appears.'--‘Undistinguished it lies in the chancel's gloom,No memorial sad it bears'--The Canon his paternoster reads,His rosary hung by his side,Now swift to the chancel doors he leads,And untouched they open wide,Resistless, strange sounds his steps impel,To approach to the black marble tomb,'Oh! enter, Black Canon,' a whisper fell,'Oh! enter, thy hour is come.'He paused, told his beads, and the threshold passed.Oh! horror, the chancel doors close, A loud yell was borne on the rising blast,And a deep, dying groan arose.The Monks in amazement shuddering stand,They burst through the chancel's gloom,From St. Edmond’s shrine, lo! a skeleton’s hand, Points to the black marble tomb.Lo! deeply engraved, an inscription blood red,In characters fresh and clear--'The guilty Black Canon of Elmham's dead,And his wife lies buried here!'In Elmham’s tower he wedded a Nun,To St. Edmond’s his bride he bore,On this eve her noviciate here was begun,And a Monk’s gray weeds she wore;--O! deep was her conscience dyed with guilt,Remorse she full oft revealed,Her blood by the ruthless Black Canon was spilt,And in death her lips he sealed;Her spirit to penance this night was doomed,'Till the Canon atoned the deed,Here together they now shall rest entombed,'Till their bodies from dust are freed--Hark! a loud peal of thunder shakes the roof,Round the altar bright lightnings play,Speechless with horror the Monks stand aloof, And the storm dies sudden away--The inscription was gone! a cross on the ground,And a rosary shone through the gloom,But never again was the Canon there found,Or the Ghost on the black marble tomb.

I Would Not Be A King,"                        I would not be a king--enoughOf woe it is to love;The path to power is steep and rough,And tempests reign above.I would not climb the imperial throne; ’Tis built on ice which fortune’s sunThaws in the height of noon.Then farewell, king, yet were I one,Care would not come so soon.Would he and I were far away Keeping flocks on Himalay!

Song For 'Tasso',"                        I.I loved—alas! our life is love;But when we cease to breathe and moveI do suppose love ceases too.I thought, but not as now I do,Keen thoughts and bright of linked lore,Of all that men had thought before.And all that Nature shows, and more.II.And still I love and still I think,But strangely, for my heart can drinkThe dregs of such despair, and live,And love;...And if I think, my thoughts come fast,I mix the present with the past,And each seems uglier than the last.III.Sometimes I see before me flee 15A silver spirit’s form, like thee,O Leonora, and I sit...still watching it,Till by the grated casement’s ledgeIt fades, with such a sigh, as sedge Breathes o’er the breezy streamlet’s edge.

Fragments Of An Unfinished Drama,"                        Scene.--Before the Cavern of the Indian Enchantress.The Enchantress comes forth.Enchantress.He came like a dream in the dawn of life,He fled like a shadow before its noon;He is gone, and my peace is turned to strife,And I wander and wane like the weary moon.O, sweet Echo, wake,And for my sakeMake answer the while my heart shall break!But my heart has a music which Echo's lips,Though tender and true, yet can answer not,And the shadow that moves in the soul's eclipseCan return not the kiss by his now forgot;Sweet lips! he who hathOn my desolate pathCast the darkness of absence, worse than death!The Enchantress makes her spell: she is answered by a Spirit.Spirit.Within the silent centre of the earthMy mansion is; where I have lived inspheredFrom the beginning, and around my sleepHave woven all the wondrous imageryOf this dim spot, which mortals call the world;Infinite depths of unknown elementsMassed into one impenetrable mask;Sheets of immeasurable fire, and veinsOf gold and stone, and adamantine iron.And as a veil in which I walk through HeavenI have wrought mountains, seas, and waves, and clouds,And lastly light, whose interfusion dawnsIn the dark space of interstellar air.ANOTHER SCENEIndian Youth and Lady.Indian.And, if my grief should still be dearer to meThan all the pleasures in the world beside,Why would you lighten it?-Lady.I offer onlyThat which I seek, some human sympathyIn this mysterious island.Indian.Oh! my friend,My sister, my beloved!-What do I say?My brain is dizzy, and I scarce know whetherI speak to thee or her.Lady.Peace, perturbed heart!I am to thee only as thou to mine,The passing wind which heals the brow at noon,And may strike cold into the breast at night,Yet cannot linger where it soothes the most,Or long soothe could it linger.Indian.But you saidYou also loved?Lady.Loved! Oh, I love. MethinksThis word of love is fit for all the world,And that for gentle hearts another nameWould speak of gentler thoughts than the world owns.I have loved.Indian.And thou lovest not? if so,Young as thou art thou canst afford to weep.Lady.Oh! would that I could claim exemptionFrom all the bitterness of that sweet name.I loved, I love, and when I love no moreLet joys and grief perish, and leave despairTo ring the knell of youth. He stood beside me,The embodied vision of the brightest dream,Which like a dawn heralds the day of life;The shadow of his presence made my worldA Paradise. All familiar things he touched,All common words he spoke, became to meLike forms and sounds of a diviner world.He was as is the sun in his fierce youth,As terrible and lovely as a tempest;He came, and went, and left me what I am.Alas! Why must I think how oft we twoHave sate together near the river springs,Under the green pavilion which the willowSpreads on the floor of the unbroken fountain,Strewn, by the nurslings that linger there,Over that islet paved with flowers and moss,While the musk-rose leaves, like flakes of crimson snow,Showered on us, and the dove mourned in the pine,Sad prophetess of sorrows not her own?The crane returned to her unfrozen haunt,And the false cuckoo bade the spray good morn;And on a wintry bough the widowed bird,Hid in the deepest night of ivy-leaves,Renewed the vigils of a sleepless sorrow.I, left like her, and leaving one like her,Alike abandoned and abandoning(Oh! unlike her in this!) the gentlest youth,Whose love had made my sorrows dear to him,Even as my sorrow made his love to me!Indian.One curse of Nature stamps in the same mouldThe features of the wretched; and they areAs like as violet to violet,When memory, the ghost, their odours keepsMid the cold relics of abandoned joy.-Proceed.Lady.He was a simple innocent boy.I loved him well, but not as he desired;Yet even thus he was content to be:-A short content, for I was-Indian[aside].God of Heaven!From such an islet, such a river-spring-!I dare not ask her if there stood upon itA pleasure-dome surmounted by a crescent,With steps to the blue water. [Aloud.]It may beThat Nature masks in life several copiesOf the same lot, so that the sufferersMay feel another's sorrow as their own,And find in friendship what they lost in love.That cannot be: yet it is strange that we,From the same scene, by the same path to thisRealm of abandonment -- But speak! your breath-Your breath is like soft music, your words areThe echoes of a voice which on my heartSleeps like a melody of early days.But as you said-- Lady.He was so awful, yetSo beautiful in mystery and terror,Calming me as the loveliness of heavenSoothes the unquiet sea:-and yet not so,For he seemed stormy, and would often seemA quenchless sun masked in portentous clouds;For such his thoughts, and even his actions were;But he was not of them, nor they of him,But as they hid his splendour from the earth.Some said he was a man of blood and peril,And steeped in bitter infamy to the lips.More need was there I should be innocent,More need that I should be most true and kind,And much more need that there should be found oneTo share remorse and scorn and solitude,And all the ills that wait on those who doThe tasks of ruin in the world of life.He fled, and I have followed him.Indian.Such a oneIs he who was the winter of my peace.But, fairest stranger, when didst thou departFrom the far hills where rise the springs of India?How didst thou pass the intervening sea?Lady.If I be sure I am not dreaming now,I should not doubt to say it was a dream.Methought a star came down from heaven,And rested mid the plants of India,Which I had given a shelter from the frostWithin my chamber. There the meteor lay,Panting forth light among the leaves and flowers,As if it lived, and was outworn with speed;Or that it loved, and passion made the pulseOf its bright life throb like an anxious heart,Till it diffused itself, and all the chamberAnd walls seemed melted into emerald fireThat burned not; in the midst of which appearedA spirit like a child, and laughed aloudA thrilling peal of such sweet merrimentAs made the blood tingle in my warm feet:Then bent over a vase, and murmuringLow, unintelligible melodies,Placed something in the mould like melon-seeds,And slowly faded, and in place of itA soft hand issued from the veil of fire,Holding a cup like a magnolia flower,And poured upon the earth within the vaseThe element with which it overflowed,Brighter than morning light, and purer thanThe water of the springs of Himalah.Indian.You waked not?Lady.Not until my dream becameLike a child's legend on the tideless sand,Which the first foam erases half, and halfLeaves legible. At length I rose, and went,Visiting my flowers from pot to pot, and thoughtTo set new cuttings in the empty urns,And when I came to that beside the lattice,I saw two little dark-green leavesLifting the light mould at their birth, and thenI half-remembered my forgotten dream.And day by day, green as a gourd in June,The plant grew fresh and thick, yet no one knewWhat plant it was; its stem and tendrils seemedLike emerald snakes, mottled and diamondedWith azure mail and streaks of woven silver;And all the sheaths that folded the dark budsRose like the crest of cobra-di-capel,Until the golden eye of the bright flower,Through the dark lashes of those veinèd lids,....disencumbered of their silent sleep,Gazed like a star into the morning light.Its leaves were delicate, you almost sawThe pulsesWith which the purple velvet flower was fedTo overflow, and like a poet's heartChanging bright fancy to sweet sentiment,Changed half the light to fragrance. It soon fell,And to a green and dewy embryo-fruitLeft all its treasured beauty. Day by dayI nursed the plant, and on the double flutePlayed to it on the sunny winter daysSoft melodies, as sweet as April rainOn silent leaves, and sang those words in whichPassion makes Echo taunt the sleeping strings;And I would send tales of forgotten loveLate into the lone night, and sing wild songsOf maids deserted in the olden time,And weep like a soft cloud in April's bosomUpon the sleeping eyelids of the plant,So that perhaps it dreamed that Spring was come,And crept abroad into the moonlight air,And loosened all its limbs, as, noon by noon,The sun averted less his oblique beam.Indian.And the plant died not in the frost?Lady.It grew;And went out of the lattice which I leftHalf open for it, trailing its quaint spiresAlong the garden and across the lawn,And down the slope of moss and through the tuftsOf wild-flower roots, and stumps of trees o'ergrownWith simple lichens, and old hoary stones,On to the margin of the glassy pool,Even to a nook of unblown violetsAnd lilies-of-the-valley yet unborn,Under a pine with ivy overgrown.And there its fruit lay like a sleeping lizardUnder the shadows; but when Spring indeedCame to unswathe her infants, and the liliesPeeped from their bright green masks to wonder atThis shape of autumn couched in their recess,Then it dilated, and it grew untilOne half lay floating on the fountain wave,Whose pulse, elapsed in unlike sympathies,Kept timeAmong the snowy water-lily buds.Its shape was such as summer melodyOf the south wind in spicy vales might giveTo some light cloud bound from the golden dawnTo fairy isles of evening, and it seemedIn hue and form that it had been a mirrorOf all the hues and forms around it andUpon it pictured by the sunny beamsWhich, from the bright vibrations of the pool,Were thrown upon the rafters and the roofOf boughs and leaves, and on the pillared stemsOf the dark sylvan temple, and reflectionsOf every infant flower and star of mossAnd veined leaf in the azure odorous air.And thus it lay in the Elysian calmOf its own beauty, floating on the lineWhich, like a film in purest space, dividedThe heaven beneath the water from the heavenAbove the clouds; and every day I wentWatching its growth and wondering;And as the day grew hot, methought I sawA glassy vapour dancing on the pool,And on it little quaint and filmy shapes,With dizzy motion, wheel and rise and fall,Like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments...O friend, sleep was a veil uplift from Heaven--As if Heaven dawned upon the world of dream--When darkness rose on the extinguished dayOut of the eastern wilderness.Indian.I tooHave found a moment's paradise in sleepHalf compensate a hell of waking sorrow.

Orpheus,"                        A:Not far from hence. From yonder pointed hill,Crowned with a ring of oaks, you may beholdA dark and barren field, through which there flows,Sluggish and black, a deep but narrow stream,Which the wind ripples not, and the fair moon Gazes in vain, and finds no mirror there.Follow the herbless banks of that strange brookUntil you pause beside a darksome pond,The fountain of this rivulet, whose gushCannot be seen, hid by a rayless night That lives beneath the overhanging rockThat shades the pool—an endless spring of gloom,Upon whose edge hovers the tender light,Trembling to mingle with its paramour,--But, as Syrinx fled Pan, so night flies day, Or, with most sullen and regardless hate,Refuses stern her heaven-born embrace.On one side of this jagged and shapeless hillThere is a cave, from which there eddies upA pale mist, like aereal gossamer, Whose breath destroys all life--awhile it veilsThe rock—then, scattered by the wind, it fliesAlong the stream, or lingers on the clefts,Killing the sleepy worms, if aught bide there.Upon the beetling edge of that dark rock There stands a group of cypresses; not suchAs, with a graceful spire and stirring life,Pierce the pure heaven of your native vale,Whose branches the air plays among, but notDisturbs, fearing to spoil their solemn grace;But blasted and all wearily they stand,One to another clinging; their weak boughsSigh as the wind buffets them, and they shakeBeneath its blasts—a weatherbeaten crew!CHORUS:What wondrous sound is that, mournful and faint,But more melodious than the murmuring windWhich through the columns of a temple glides?A:It is the wandering voice of Orpheus’ lyre,Borne by the winds, who sigh that their rude kingHurries them fast from these air-feeding notes; But in their speed they bear along with themThe waning sound, scattering it like dewUpon the startled sense.CHORUS:Does he still sing?Methought he rashly cast away his harpWhen he had lost Eurydice.A:Ah, no! Awhile he paused. As a poor hunted stagA moment shudders on the fearful brinkOf a swift stream—the cruel hounds press onWith deafening yell, the arrows glance and wound,--He plunges in: so Orpheus, seized and torn By the sharp fangs of an insatiate grief,Maenad-like waved his lyre in the bright air,And wildly shrieked ‘Where she is, it is dark!’And then he struck from forth the strings a soundOf deep and fearful melody. Alas! In times long past, when fair EurydiceWith her bright eyes sat listening by his side,He gently sang of high and heavenly themes.As in a brook, fretted with little wavesBy the light airs of spring—each riplet makes A many-sided mirror for the sun,While it flows musically through green banks,Ceaseless and pauseless, ever clear and fresh,So flowed his song, reflecting the deep joyAnd tender love that fed those sweetest notes,The heavenly offspring of ambrosial food.But that is past. Returning from drear Hell,He chose a lonely seat of unhewn stone,Blackened with lichens, on a herbless plain.Then from the deep and overflowing spring Of his eternal ever-moving griefThere rose to Heaven a sound of angry song.’Tis as a mighty cataract that partsTwo sister rocks with waters swift and strong, And casts itself with horrid roar and dinAdown a steep; from a perennial sourceIt ever flows and falls, and breaks the airWith loud and fierce, but most harmonious roar,And as it falls casts up a vaporous sprayWhich the sun clothes in hues of Iris light. Thus the tempestuous torrent of his griefIs clothed in sweetest sounds and varying wordsOf poesy. Unlike all human works,It never slackens, and through every changeWisdom and beauty and the power divine Of mighty poesy together dwell,Mingling in sweet accord. As I have seenA fierce south blast tear through the darkened sky,Driving along a rack of winged clouds,Which may not pause, but ever hurry on, As their wild shepherd wills them, while the stars,Twinkling and dim, peep from between the plumes.Anon the sky is cleared, and the high domeOf serene Heaven, starred with fiery flowers,Shuts in the shaken earth; or the still moon Swiftly, yet gracefully, begins her walk,Rising all bright behind the eastern hills.I talk of moon, and wind, and stars, and notOf song; but, would I echo his high song,Nature must lend me words ne’er used before,Or I must borrow from her perfect works,To picture forth his perfect attributes.He does no longer sit upon his throneOf rock upon a desert herbless plain,For the evergreen and knotted ilexes,And cypresses that seldom wave their boughs,And sea-green olives with their grateful fruit,And elms dragging along the twisted vines,Which drop their berries as they follow fast,And blackthorn bushes with their infant race Of blushing rose-blooms; beeches, to lovers dear,And weeping willow trees; all swift or slow,As their huge boughs or lighter dress permit,Have circled in his throne, and Earth herselfHas sent from her maternal breast a growth Of starlike flowers and herbs of odour sweet,To pave the temple that his poesyHas framed, while near his feet grim lions couch,And kids, fearless from love, creep near his lair.Even the blind worms seem to feel the sound.The birds are silent, hanging down their heads,Perched on the lowest branches of the trees;Not even the nightingale intrudes a noteIn rivalry, but all entranced she listens.

"Stanzas Written In Dejection, Near Naples","                        I.The sun is warm, the sky is clear, The waves are dancing fast and bright, Blue isles and snowy mountains wear The purple noon's transparent might, The breath of the moist earth is light, Around its unexpanded buds; Like many a voice of one delight The winds, the birds, the ocean floods, The city's voice itself, is soft like Solitude's. II.I see the deep's untrampled floor With green and purple seaweeds strown; I see the waves upon the shore, Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown: I sit upon the sands alone,-- The lightning of the noontide ocean Is flashing round me, and a tone Arises from its measured motion, How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion. III.Alas! I have nor hope nor health, Nor peace within nor calm around, Nor that content surpassing wealth The sage in meditation found, And walked with inward glory crowned-- Nor fame nor power, nor love, nor leisure, Others I see whom these surround-- Smiling they live, and call life pleasure;-- To me that cup has been dealt in another measure. IV.Yet now despair itself is mild, Even as the winds and waters are; I could lie down like a tired child, And weep away the life of care Which I have born and yet must bear, Till death like sleep might steal on me, And I might feel in the warm air My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony. V.Some might lament that I were cold, As I, when this sweet day is gone, Which my lost heart, too soon grown old, Insults with this untimely moan; They might lament -- for I am one Whom men love not,-- and yet regret, Unlike this day, which, when the sun Shall on its stainless glory set, Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.

Revenge does not howl in the dead.Nor ambition with fame crown the murderer’s head.III.Though weak as the lama that bounds on the mountains,And endued not with fast-fleeting footsteps of air, Yet, yet will I draw from the purest of fountains,Though a fiercer than tiger is there.Though, more dreadful than death, it scatters despair,Though its shadow eclipses the day,And the darkness of deepest dismay Spreads the influence of soul-chilling terror around,And lowers on the corpses, that rot on the ground.IV.They came to the fountain to draw from its streamWaves too pure, too celestial, for mortals to see;They bathed for awhile in its silvery beam,Then perished, and perished like me.For in vain from the grasp of the Bigot I flee;The most tenderly loved of my soulAre slaves to his hated control.He pursues me, he blasts me!

Ginevra,"                        Wild, pale, and wonder-stricken, even as oneWho staggers forth into the air and sunFrom the dark chamber of a mortal fever,Bewildered, and incapable, and everFancying strange comments in her dizzy brain Of usual shapes, till the familiar trainOf objects and of persons passed like thingsStrange as a dreamer’s mad imaginings,Ginevra from the nuptial altar went;The vows to which her lips had sworn assent Rung in her brain still with a jarring din,Deafening the lost intelligence within.And so she moved under the bridal veil,Which made the paleness of her cheek more pale,And deepened the faint crimson of her mouth,And darkened her dark locks, as moonlight doth,--And of the gold and jewels glittering thereShe scarce felt conscious,--but the weary glareLay like a chaos of unwelcome light,Vexing the sense with gorgeous undelight,A moonbeam in the shadow of a cloudWas less heavenly fair--her face was bowed,And as she passed, the diamonds in her hairWere mirrored in the polished marble stairWhich led from the cathedral to the street;And ever as she went her light fair feetErased these images.The bride-maidens who round her thronging came,Some with a sense of self-rebuke and shame,Envying the unenviable; and othersMaking the joy which should have been another’sTheir own by gentle sympathy; and someSighing to think of an unhappy home:Some few admiring what can ever lureMaidens to leave the heaven serene and pureOf parents’ smiles for life’s great cheat; a thingBitter to taste, sweet in imagining.But they are all dispersed--and, lo! she standsLooking in idle grief on her white hands,Alone within the garden now her own; And through the sunny air, with jangling tone,The music of the merry marriage-bells,Killing the azure silence, sinks and swells;--Absorbed like one within a dream who dreamsThat he is dreaming, until slumber seems A mockery of itself--when suddenlyAntonio stood before her, pale as she.With agony, with sorrow, and with pride,He lifted his wan eyes upon the bride,And said--‘Is this thy faith?’ and then as one Whose sleeping face is stricken by the sunWith light like a harsh voice, which bids him riseAnd look upon his day of life with eyesWhich weep in vain that they can dream no more,Ginevra saw her lover, and forboreTo shriek or faint, and checked the stifling bloodRushing upon her heart, and unsubduedSaid--‘Friend, if earthly violence or ill,Suspicion, doubt, or the tyrannic willOf parents, chance or custom, time or change,Or circumstance, or terror, or revenge,Or wildered looks, or words, or evil speech,With all their stings and venom can impeachOur love,--we love not:--if the grave which hidesThe victim from the tyrant, and dividesThe cheek that whitens from the eyes that dartImperious inquisition to the heartThat is another’s, could dissever ours,We love not.’--‘What! do not the silent hoursBeckon thee to Gherardi’s bridal bed?

Some melted into tears without a sob,And some with hearts that might be heard to throbLeaned on the table and at intervalsShuddered to hear through the deserted hallsAnd corridors the thrilling shrieks which cameUpon the breeze of night, that shook the flameOf every torch and taper as it sweptFrom out the chamber where the women kept;--Their tears fell on the dear companion coldOf pleasures now departed; then was knolled The bell of death, and soon the priests arrived,And finding Death their penitent had shrived,Returned like ravens from a corpse whereonA vulture has just feasted to the bone.And then the mourning women came.--...THE DIRGE.Old winter was goneIn his weakness back to the mountains hoar,And the spring came downFrom the planet that hovers upon the shoreWhere the sea of sunlight encroaches On the limits of wintry night;--If the land, and the air, and the sea,Rejoice not when spring approaches,We did not rejoice in thee,Ginevra! She is still, she is coldOn the bridal couch,One step to the white deathbed,And one to the bier,And one to the charnel--and one, oh where? The dark arrow fledIn the noon.Ere the sun through heaven once more has rolled,The rats in her heartWill have made their nest, And the worms be alive in her golden hair,While the Spirit that guides the sun,Sits throned in his flaming chair,She shall sleep.

Pyramids,That for millenniums had withstood the tideOf human things, his storm-breath drove in sandAcross that desert where their stones survivedThe name of him whose pride had heaped them there.Yon monarch, in his solitary pomp,Was but the mushroom of a summer day,That his light-wingÃ¨d footstep pressed to dust;Time was the king of earth; all things gave wayBefore him but the fixed and virtuous will,The sacred sympathies of soul and sense,That mocked his fury and prepared his fall.'Yet slow and gradual dawned the morn of love;Long lay the clouds of darkness o'er the scene,Till from its native heaven they rolled away:First, crime triumphant o'er all hope careeredUnblushing, undisguising, bold and strong,Whilst falsehood, tricked in virtue's attributes,Long sanctified all deeds of vice and woe,Till, done by her own venomous sting to death,She left the moral world without a law,No longer fettering passion's fearless wing,Nor searing reason with the brand of God.Then steadily the happy ferment worked;Reason was free; and wild though passion went Through tangled glens and wood-embosomed meads,Gathering a garland of the strangest flowers,Yet, like the bee returning to her queen,She bound the sweetest on her sister's brow,Who meek and sober kissed the sportive child,No longer trembling at the broken rod.'Mild was the slow necessity of death.The tranquil spirit failed beneath its grasp,Without a groan, almost without a fear,Calm as a voyager to some distant land,And full of wonder, full of hope as he.The deadly germs of languor and diseaseDied in the human frame, and purityBlessed with all gifts her earthly worshippers.How vigorous then the athletic form of age!How clear its open and unwrinkled brow!Where neither avarice, cunning, pride or careHad stamped the seal of gray deformityOn all the mingling lineaments of time.How lovely the intrepid front of youth,Which meek-eyed courage decked with freshest grace;Courage of soul, that dreaded not a name,And elevated will, that journeyed onThrough life's phantasmal scene in fearlessness,With virtue, love and pleasure, hand in hand!'Then, that sweet bondage which is freedom's self,And rivets with sensation's softest tieThe kindred sympathies of human souls,Needed no fetters of tyrannic law.Those delicate and timid impulsesIn Nature's primal modesty arose,And with undoubting confidence disclosedThe growing longings of its dawning love,Unchecked by dull and selfish chastity,That virtue of the cheaply virtuous,Who pride themselves in senselessness and frost.No longer prostitution's venomed banePoisoned the springs of happiness and life;Woman and man, in confidence and love,Equal and free and pure together trod The mountain-paths of virtue, which no moreWere stained with blood from many a pilgrim's feet.'Then, where, through distant ages, long in prideThe palace of the monarch-slave had mockedFamine's faint groan and penury's silent tear,A heap of crumbling ruins stood, and threwYear after year their stones upon the field,Wakening a lonely echo; and the leavesOf the old thorn, that on the topmost towerUsurped the royal ensign's grandeur, shookIn the stern storm that swayed the topmost tower,And whispered strange tales in the whirlwind's ear.'Low through the lone cathedral's roofless aislesThe melancholy winds a death-dirge sung.It were a sight of awfulness to seeThe works of faith and slavery, so vast,So sumptuous, yet so perishing withal,Even as the corpse that rests beneath its wall!A thousand mourners deck the pomp of deathTo-day, the breathing marble glows above To decorate its memory, and tonguesAre busy of its life; to-morrow, wormsIn silence and in darkness seize their prey.'Within the massy prison's mouldering courts,Fearless and free the ruddy children played,Weaving gay chaplets for their innocent browsWith the green ivy and the red wall-flowerThat mock the dungeon's unavailing gloom;The ponderous chains and gratings of strong ironThere rusted amid heaps of broken stone That mingled slowly with their native earth;There the broad beam of day, which feebly onceLighted the cheek of lean captivityWith a pale and sickly glare, then freely shoneOn the pure smiles of infant playfulness;No more the shuddering voice of hoarse despairPealed through the echoing vaults, but soothing notesOf ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birdsAnd merriment were resonant around.'These ruins soon left not a wreck behind; Their elements, wide-scattered o'er the globe,To happier shapes were moulded, and becameMinistrant to all blissful impulses;Thus human things were perfected, and earth,Even as a child beneath its mother's love,Was strengthened in all excellence, and grewFairer and nobler with each passing year.'Now Time his dusky pennons o'er the sceneCloses in steadfast darkness, and the pastFades from our charmÃ¨d sight. My task is done;Thy lore is learned. Earth's wonders are thine ownWith all the fear and all the hope they bring.My spells are passed; the present now recurs.Ah me! a pathless wilderness remainsYet unsubdued by man's reclaiming hand.'Yet, human Spirit! bravely hold thy course;Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursueThe gradual paths of an aspiring change;For birth and life and death, and that strange stateBefore the naked soul has found its home,All tend to perfect happiness, and urgeThe restless wheels of being on their way,Whose flashing spokes, instinct with infinite life,Bicker and burn to gain their destined goal;For birth but wakes the spirit to the senseOf outward shows, whose unexperienced shapeNew modes of passion to its frame may lend;Life is its state of action, and the storeOf all events is aggregated thereThat variegate the eternal universe;Death is a gate of dreariness and gloom,That leads to azure isles and beaming skiesAnd happy regions of eternal hope.Therefore, O Spirit! fearlessly bear on.Though storms may break the primrose on its stalk,Though frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom,Yet spring's awakening breath will woo the earthTo feed with kindliest dews its favorite flower,That blooms in mossy bank and darksome glens,Lighting the greenwood with its sunny smile.'Fear not then, Spirit, death's disrobing hand,So welcome when the tyrant is awake,So welcome when the bigot's hell-torch burns;'T is but the voyage of a darksome hour,The transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep.Death is no foe to virtue; earth has seenLove's brightest roses on the scaffold bloom,Mingling with freedom's fadeless laurels there,And presaging the truth of visioned bliss.Are there not hopes within thee, which this scene Of linked and gradual being has confirmed?Whose stingings bade thy heart look further still,When, to the moonlight walk by Henry led,Sweetly and sadly thou didst talk of death?And wilt thou rudely tear them from thy breast,Listening supinely to a bigot's creed,Or tamely crouching to the tyrant's rod,Whose iron thongs are red with human gore?Never: but bravely bearing on, thy willIs destined an eternal war to wageWith tyranny and falsehood, and uprootThe germs of misery from the human heart.Thine is the hand whose piety would sootheThe thorny pillow of unhappy crime,Whose impotence an easy pardon gains,Watching its wanderings as a friend's disease;Thine is the brow whose mildness would defyIts fiercest rage, and brave its sternest will,When fenced by power and master of the world.Thou art sincere and good; of resolute mind,Free from heart-withering custom's cold control,Of passion lofty, pure and unsubdued.Earth's pride and meanness could not vanquish thee,And therefore art thou worthy of the boonWhich thou hast now received; virtue shall keepThy footsteps in the path that thou hast trod,And many days of beaming hope shall blessThy spotless life of sweet and sacred love.Go, happy one, and give that bosom joy,Whose sleepless spirit waits to catchLight, life and rapture from thy smile!'The Fairy waves her wand of charm.Speechless with bliss the Spirit mounts the car,That rolled beside the battlement,Bending her beamy eyes in thankfulness.Again the enchanted steeds were yoked;Again the burning wheels inflameThe steep descent of heaven's untrodden way.Fast and far the chariot flew;The vast and fiery globes that rolled Around the Fairy's palace-gateLessened by slow degrees, and soon appearedSuch tiny twinklers as the planet orbsThat there attendant on the solar powerWith borrowed light pursued their narrower way.Earth floated then below;The chariot paused a moment there;The Spirit then descended;The restless coursers pawed the ungenial soil,Snuffed the gross air, and then, their errand done,Unfurled their pinions to the winds of heaven.The Body and the Soul united then.A gentle start convulsed Ianthe's frame;Her veiny eyelids quietly unclosed;Moveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained.She looked around in wonder, and beheldHenry, who kneeled in silence by her couch,Watching her sleep with looks of speechless love,And the bright beaming starsThat through the casement shone.

Queen Mab: Part Ii.,"                        If solitude hath ever led thy stepsTo the wild ocean's echoing shore,And thou hast lingered there,Until the sun's broad orbSeemed resting on the burnished wave,Thou must have marked the linesOf purple gold that motionlessHung o'er the sinking sphere;Thou must have marked the billowy clouds,Edged with intolerable radiancy,Towering like rocks of jetCrowned with a diamond wreath;And yet there is a moment,When the sun's highest pointPeeps like a star o'er ocean's western edge,When those far clouds of feathery gold,Shaded with deepest purple, gleamLike islands on a dark blue sea;Then has thy fancy soared above the earthAnd furled its wearied wingWithin the Fairy's fane.Yet not the golden islandsGleaming in yon flood of light,Nor the feathery curtainsStretching o'er the sun's bright couch,Nor the burnished ocean-wavesPaving that gorgeous dome,So fair, so wonderful a sightAs Mab's ethereal palace could afford.Yet likest evening's vault, that faÃ«ry Hall!As Heaven, low resting on the wave, it spreadIts floors of flashing light,Its vast and azure dome,Its fertile golden islandsFloating on a silver sea;Whilst suns their mingling beamings dartedThrough clouds of circumambient darkness,And pearly battlements aroundLooked o'er the immense of Heaven.The magic car no longer moved.The Fairy and the SpiritEntered the Hall of Spells.Those golden cloudsThat rolled in glittering billowsBeneath the azure canopy,With the ethereal footsteps trembled not;The light and crimson mists,Floating to strains of thrilling melodyThrough that unearthly dwelling,Yielded to every movement of the will;Upon their passive swell the Spirit leaned,And, for the varied bliss that pressed around,Used not the glorious privilegeOf virtue and of wisdom.'Spirit!' the Fairy said,And pointed to the gorgeous dome,'This is a wondrous sightAnd mocks all human grandeur;But, were it virtue's only meed to dwellIn a celestial palace, all resigned To pleasurable impulses, immuredWithin the prison of itself, the willOf changeless Nature would be unfulfilled.Learn to make others happy. Spirit, come!This is thine high reward:-the past shall rise;Thou shalt behold the present; I will teachThe secrets of the future.'The Fairy and the SpiritApproached the overhanging battlement.Below lay stretched the universe!There, far as the remotest lineThat bounds imagination's flight,Countless and unending orbsIn mazy motion intermingled,Yet still fulfilled immutablyEternal Nature's law.Above, below, around,The circling systems formedA wilderness of harmony;Each with undeviating aim,In eloquent silence, through the depths of spacePursued its wondrous way.There was a little lightThat twinkled in the misty distance.None but a spirit's eyeMight ken that rolling orb.None but a spirit's eye,And in no other placeBut that celestial dwelling, might beholdEach action of this earth's inhabitants.But matter, space, and time,In those aÃ«rial mansions cease to act;And all-prevailing wisdom, when it reapsThe harvest of its excellence, o'erboundsThose obstacles of which an earthly soulFears to attempt the conquest.The Fairy pointed to the earth.The Spirit's intellectual eyeIts kindred beings recognized.The thronging thousands, to a passing view,Seemed like an ant-hill's citizens.How wonderful! that evenThe passions, prejudices, interests,That sway the meanest being-the weak touchThat moves the finest nerveAnd in one human brainCauses the faintest thought, becomes a linkIn the great chain of Nature!'Behold,' the Fairy cried,'Palmyra's ruined palaces!Behold where grandeur frowned!Behold where pleasure smiled!What now remains?-the memoryOf senselessness and shame.What is immortal there?Nothing-it stands to tellA melancholy tale, to giveAn awful warning; soonOblivion will steal silentlyThe remnant of its fame.Monarchs and conquerors thereProud o'er prostrate millions trod-The earthquakes of the human race;Like them, forgotten when the ruinThat marks their shock is past.'Beside the eternal NileThe Pyramids have risen.Nile shall pursue his changeless way;Those Pyramids shall fall.Yea! not a stone shall stand to tellThe spot whereon they stood;Their very site shall be forgotten,As is their builder's name!'Behold yon sterile spot,Where now the wandering Arab's tentFlaps in the desert blast!There once old Salem's haughty faneReared high to heaven its thousand golden domes,And in the blushing face of dayExposed its shameful glory.Oh! many a widow, many an orphan cursedThe building of that fane; and many a father,Worn out with toil and slavery, imploredThe poor man's God to sweep it from the earthAnd spare his children the detested taskOf piling stone on stone and poisoningThe choicest days of lifeTo soothe a dotard's vanity.There an inhuman and uncultured raceHowled hideous praises to their Demon-God;They rushed to war, tore from the mother's wombThe unborn child-old age and infancyPromiscuous perished; their victorious armsLeft not a soul to breathe. Oh! they were fiends!But what was he who taught them that the GodOf Nature and benevolence had givenA special sanction to the trade of blood?His name and theirs are fading, and the talesOf this barbarian nation, which impostureRecites till terror credits, are pursuing Itself into forgetfulness.'Where Athens, Rome, and Sparta stood,There is a moral desert now.The mean and miserable huts,The yet more wretched palaces,Contrasted with those ancient fanesNow crumbling to oblivion,-The long and lonely colonnadesThrough which the ghost of Freedom stalks,-Seem like a well-known tune, Which in some dear scene we have loved to hear,Remembered now in sadness.But, oh! how much more changed,How gloomier is the contrastOf human nature there!Where Socrates expired, a tyrant's slave,A coward and a fool, spreads death around-Then, shuddering, meets his own.Where Cicero and Antoninus lived,A cowled and hypocritical monk Prays, curses and deceives.'Spirit! ten thousand yearsHave scarcely passed away,Since in the waste, where now the savage drinksHis enemy's blood, and, aping Europe's sons,Wakes the unholy song of war,Arose a stately city,Metropolis of the western continent.There, now, the mossy column-stone,Indented by time's unrelaxing grasp, Which once appeared to braveAll, save its country's ruin,-There the wide forest scene,Rude in the uncultivated lovelinessOf gardens long run wild,-Seems, to the unwilling sojourner whose stepsChance in that desert has delayed,Thus to have stood since earth was what it is.Yet once it was the busiest haunt,Whither, as to a common centre, flockedStrangers, and ships, and merchandise;Once peace and freedom blestThe cultivated plain;But wealth, that curse of man,Blighted the bud of its prosperity;Virtue and wisdom, truth and liberty,Fled, to return not, until man shall knowThat they alone can give the blissWorthy a soul that claimsIts kindred with eternity. 'There 's not one atom of yon earthBut once was living man;Nor the minutest drop of rain,That hangeth in its thinnest cloud,But flowed in human veins;And from the burning plainsWhere Libyan monsters yell,From the most gloomy glensOf Greenland's sunless clime,To where the golden fields Of fertile England spreadTheir harvest to the day,Thou canst not find one spotWhereon no city stood.'How strange is human pride!I tell thee that those living things,To whom the fragile blade of grassThat springeth in the mornAnd perisheth ere noon,Is an unbounded world;I tell thee that those viewless beings,Whose mansion is the smallest particleOf the impassive atmosphere,Think, feel and live like man;That their affections and antipathies,Like his, produce the lawsRuling their moral state;And the minutest throbThat through their frame diffusesThe slightest, faintest motion,Is fixed and indispensableAs the majestic lawsThat rule yon rolling orbs.'The Fairy paused. The Spirit,In ecstasy of admiration, feltAll knowledge of the past revived; the eventsOf old and wondrous times,Which dim tradition interruptedlyTeaches the credulous vulgar, were unfoldedIn just perspective to the view; Yet dim from their infinitude.The Spirit seemed to standHigh on an isolated pinnacle;The flood of ages combating below,The depth of the unbounded universeAbove, and all aroundNature's unchanging harmony.

Peter Bell The Third,"                        BY MICHING MALLECHO, Esq.Is it a party in a parlour,Crammed just as they on earth were crammed,Some sipping punch-some sipping tea;But, as you by their faces see,All silent, and all-damned!Peter Bell, by W. Wordsworth.Ophelia.-What means this, my lord?Hamlet.-Marry, this is Miching Mallecho; it means mischief.~Shakespeare.PROLOGUEPet er Bells, one, two and three,O'er the wide world wandering be.-First, the antenatal Peter,Wrapped in weeds of the same metre,The so-long-predestined raimentClothed in which to walk his way meantThe second Peter; whose ambitionIs to link the proposition,As the mean of two extremes-(This was learned from Aldric's themes)Shielding from the guilt of schismThe orthodoxal syllogism;The First Peter-he who wasLike the shadow in the glassOf the second, yet unripe,His substantial antitype.-Then came Peter Bell the Second,Who henceforward must be reckonedThe body of a double soul,And that portion of the wholeWithout which the rest would seemEnds of a disjointed dream.-And the Third is he who hasO'er the grave been forced to passTo the other side, which is,-Go and try else,-just like this.Peter Bell the First was PeterSmugger, milder, softer, neater,Like the soul before it isBorn from that world into this.The next Peter Bell was he,Predevote, like you and me,To good or evil as may come;His was the severer doom,-For he was an evil Cotter,And a polygamic Potter.And the last is Peter Bell,Damned since our first parents fell,Damned eternally to Hell-Surely he deserves it well!PART THE FIRSTDEATHAnd Peter Bell, when he had beenWith fresh-imported Hell-fire warmed,Grew serious-from his dress and mien'Twas very plainly to be seenPeter was quite reformed.His eyes turned up, his mouth turned down;His accent caught a nasal twang;He oiled his hair; there might be heardThe grace of God in every wordWhich Peter said or sang.But Peter now grew old, and hadAn ill no doctor could unravel;His torments almost drove him mad;-Some said it was a fever bad-Some swore it was the gravel.His holy friends then came about,And with long preaching and persuasionConvinced the patient that, withoutThe smallest shadow of a doubt,He was predestined to damnation.They said-'Thy name is Peter Bell;Thy skin is of a brimstone hue;Alive or dead-ay, sick or well-The one God made to rhyme with hell;The other, I think, rhymes with you.'Then Peter set up such a yell!-The nurse, who with some water gruelWas climbing up the stairs, as wellAs her old legs could climb them-fell,And broke them both-the fall was cruel.The Parson from the casement leptInto the lake of Windermere-And many an eel-though no adeptIn God's right reason for it-keptGnawing his kidneys half a year.And all the rest rushed through the door,And tumbled over one another,And broke their skulls.-Upon the floorMeanwhile sat Peter Bell, and swore,And cursed his father and his mother;And raved of God, and sin, and death,Blaspheming like an infidel;And said, that with his clenchèd teethHe'd seize the earth from underneath,And drag it with him down to hell.As he was speaking came a spasm,And wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder;Like one who sees a strange phantasmHe lay,-there was a silent chasmBetween his upper jaw and under.And yellow death lay on his face;And a fixed smile that was not humanTold, as I understand the case,That he was gone to the wrong place:-I heard all this from the old woman.Then there came down from Langdale PikeA cloud, with lightning, wind and hail;It swept over the mountains likeAn ocean,-and I heard it strikeThe woods and crags of Grasmere vale.And I saw the black storm comeNearer, minute after minute;Its thunder made the cataracts dumb;With hiss, and clash, and hollow hum,It neared as if the Devil was in it.The Devil was in it:-he had boughtPeter for half-a-crown; and whenThe storm which bore him vanished, noughtThat in the house that storm had caughtWas ever seen again.The gaping neighbours came next day-They found all vanished from the shore:The Bible, whence he used to pray,Half scorched under a hen-coop lay;Smashed glass-and nothing more!PART THE SECONDTHE DEVILThe Devil, I safely can aver,Has neither hoof, nor tail, nor sting;Nor is he, as some sages swear,A spirit, neither here nor there,In nothing-yet in everything.He is-what we are; for sometimesThe Devil is a gentleman;At others a bard bartering rhymesFor sack; a statesman spinning crimes;A swindler, living as he can;A thief, who cometh in the night,With whole boots and net pantaloons,Like some one whom it were not rightTo mention;-or the luckless wightFrom whom he steals nine silver spoons.But in this case he did appearLike a slop-merchant from Wapping,And with smug face, and eye severe,On every side did perk and peerTill he saw Peter dead or napping.He had on an upper Benjamin(For he was of the driving schism)In the which he wrapped his skinFrom the storm he travelled in,For fear of rheumatism.He called the ghost out of the corse;-It was exceedingly like Peter,-Only its voice was hollow and hoarse-It had a queerish look of course-Its dress too was a little neater.The Devil knew not his name and lot;Peter knew not that he was Bell:Each had an upper stream of thought,Which made all seem as it was not;Fitting itself to all things well.Peter thought he had parents dear,Brothers, sisters, cousins, cronies,In the fens of Lincolnshire;He perhaps had found them thereHad he gone and boldly shown hisSolemn phiz in his own village;Where he thought oft when a boyHe'd clomb the orchard walls to pillageThe produce of his neighbour's tillage,With marvellous pride and joy.And the Devil thought he had,'Mid the misery and confusionOf an unjust war, just madeA fortune by the gainful tradeOf giving soldiers rations bad-The world is full of strange delusion-That he had a mansion plannedIn a square like Grosvenor Square,That he was aping fashion, andThat he now came to WestmorelandTo see what was romantic there.And all this, though quite ideal,-Ready at a breath to vanish,-Was a state not more unrealThan the peace he could not feel,Or the care he could not banish.After a little conversation,The Devil told Peter, if he chose,He'd bring him to the world of fashionBy giving him a situationIn his own service-and new clothes.And Peter bowed, quite pleased and proud,And after waiting some few daysFor a new livery-dirty yellowTurned up with black-the wretched fellowWas bowled to Hell in the Devil's chaise.PART THE THIRDHELLHell is a city much like London-A populous and a smoky city;There are all sorts of people undone,And there is little or no fun done;Small justice shown, and still less pity.There is a Castles, and a Canning,A Cobbett, and a Castlereagh;All sorts of caitiff corpses planningAll sorts of cozening for trepanningCorpses less corrupt than they.There is a --, who has lostHis wits, or sold them, none knows which;He walks about a double ghost,And though as thin as Fraud almost-Ever grows more grim and rich.There is a Chancery Court; a King;A manufacturing mob; a setOf thieves who by themselves are sentSimilar thieves to represent;An army; and a public debt.Which last is a scheme of paper money,And means-being interpreted-'Bees, keep your wax-give us the honey,And we will plant, while skies are sunny,Flowers, which in winter serve instead.'There is a great talk of revolution-And a great chance of despotism-German soldiers-camps-confusion-Tumults-lotteries-ra ge-delusion-Gin-suicide-and methodism;Taxes too, on wine and bread,And meat, and beer, and tea, and cheese,From which those patriots pure are fed,Who gorge before they reel to bedThe tenfold essence of all these.There are mincing women, mewing,(Like cats, who amant miserè,)Of their own virtue, and pursuingTheir gentler sisters to that ruin,Without which-what were chastity?Lawyers-judges-old hobnobbersAre there-bailiffs-chancellors-Bishops-great and little robbers-Rhymesters-pamphleteers-stock-jobbers -Men of glory in the wars,-Things whose trade is, over ladiesTo lean, and flirt, and stare, and simper,Till all that is divine in womanGrows cruel, courteous, smooth, inhuman,Crucified 'twixt a smile and whimper.Thrusting, toiling, wailing, moiling,Frowning, preaching-such a riot!Each with never-ceasing labour,Whilst he thinks he cheats his neighbour,Cheating his own heart of quiet.And all these meet at levees;-Dinners convivial and political;-Suppers of epic poets;-teas,Where small talk dies in agonies;-Breakfasts professional and critical;Lunches and snacks so aldermanicThat one would furnish forth ten dinners,Where reigns a Cretan-tonguèd panic,Lest news Russ, Dutch, or AlemannicShould make some losers, and some winners;-At conversazioni-balls-Conventicles-and drawing-rooms-Courts of law-committees-callsOf a morning-clubs-book-stalls-Churches-masquerade s-and tombs.And this is Hell-and in this smotherAll are damnable and damned;Each one damning, damns the otherThey are damned by one another,By none other are they damned.'Tis a lie to say, 'God damns!'Where was Heaven's Attorney GeneralWhen they first gave out such flams?Let there be an end of shams,They are mines of poisonous mineral.Statesmen damn themselves to beCursed; and lawyers damn their soulsTo the auction of a fee;Churchmen damn themselves to seeGod's sweet love in burning coals.The rich are damned, beyond all cure,To taunt, and starve, and trample onThe weak and wretched; and the poorDamn their broken hearts to endureStripe on stripe, with groan on groan.Sometimes the poor are damned indeedTo take,-not means for being blessed,-But Cobbett's snuff, revenge; that weedFrom which the worms that it doth feedSqueeze less than they before possessed.And some few, like we know who,Damned-but God alone knows why-To believe their minds are givenTo make this ugly Hell a Heaven;In which faith they live and die.Thus, as in a town, plague-stricken,Each man be he sound or noMust indifferently sicken;As when day begins to thicken,None knows a pigeon from a crow,-So good and bad, sane and mad,The oppressor and the oppressed;Those who weep to see what othersSmile to inflict upon their brothers;Lovers, haters, worst and best;All are damned-they breathe an air,Thick, infected, joy-dispelling:Each pursues what seems most fair,Mining like moles, through mind, and thereScoop palace-caverns vast, where CareIn thronèd state is ever dwelling.PART THE FOURTHSINLo, Peter in Hell's Grosvenor Square,A footman in the Devil's service!And the misjudging world would swearThat every man in service thereTo virtue would prefer vice.But Peter, though now damned, was notWhat Peter was before damnation.Men oftentimes prepare a lotWhich ere it finds them, is not whatSuits with their genuine station.All things that Peter saw and feltHad a peculiar aspect to him;And when they came within the beltOf his own nature, seemed to melt,Like cloud to cloud, into him.And so the outward world unitingTo that within him, he becameConsiderably uninvitingTo those who, meditation slighting,Were moulded in a different frame.And he scorned them, and they scorned him;And he scorned all they did; and theyDid all that men of their own trimAre wont to do to please their whim,Drinking, lying, swearing, play.Such were his fellow-servants; thusHis virtue, like our own, was builtToo much on that indignant fussHypocrite Pride stirs up in usTo bully one another's guilt.He had a mind which was somehowAt once circumference and centreOf all he might or feel or know;Nothing went ever out, althoughSomething did ever enter.He had as much imaginationAs a pint-pot;-he never couldFancy another situation,From which to dart his contemplation,Than that wherein he stood.Yet his was individual mind,And new created all he sawIn a new manner, and refinedThose new creations, and combinedThem, by a master-spirit's law.Thus-though unimaginative-An apprehension clear, intense,Of his mind's work, had made aliveThe things it wrought on; I believeWakening a sort of thought in sense.But from the first 'twas Peter's driftTo be a kind of moral eunuch,He touched the hem of Nature's shift,Felt faint-and never dared upliftThe closest, all-concealing tunic.She laughed the while, with an arch smile,And kissed him with a sister's kiss,And said-'My best Diogenes,I love you well-but, if you please,Tempt not again my deepest bliss.''Tis you are cold-for I, not coy,Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;And Burns, a Scottish peasant boy-His errors prove it-knew my joyMore, learnèd friend, than you.'Bocca bacciata non perde ventura, Anzi rinnuova come fa la luna:- So thought Boccaccio, whose sweet words might cure aMale prude, like you, from what you now endure, aLow-tide in soul, like a stagnant laguna.'Then Peter rubbed his eyes severe,And smoothed his spacious forehead downWith his broad palm;-'twixt love and fear,He looked, as he no doubt felt, queer,And in his dream sate down.The Devil was no uncommon creature;A leaden-witted thief-just huddledOut of the dross and scum of nature;A toad-like lump of limb and feature,With mind, and heart, and fancy muddled.He was that heavy, dull, cold thing,The spirit of evil well may be:A drone too base to have a sting;Who gluts, and grimes his lazy wing,And calls lust, luxury.Now he was quite the kind of wightRound whom collect, at a fixed aera,Venison, turtle, hock, and claret,-Good cheer-and those who come to share it-And best East Indian madeira!It was his fancy to inviteMen of science, wit, and learning,Who came to lend each other light;He proudly thought that his gold's mightHad set those spirits burning.And men of learning, science, wit,Considered him as you and IThink of some rotten tree, and sitLounging and dining under it,Exposed to the wide sky.And all the while, with loose fat smile,The willing wretch sat winking there,Believing 'twas his power that madeThat jovial scene-and that all paidHomage to his unnoticed chair.Though to be sure this place was Hell;He was the Devil-and all they-What though the claret circled well,And wit, like ocean, rose and fell?-Were damned eternally.PART THE FIFTHGRACEAmong the guests who often stayedTill the Devil's petits-soupers,A man there came, fair as a maid,And Peter noted what he said,Standing behind his master's chair.He was a mighty poet-andA subtle-souled psychologist;All things he seemed to understand,Of old or new-of sea or land-But his own mind-which was a mist.This was a man who might have turnedHell into Heaven-and so in gladnessA Heaven unto himself have earned;But he in shadows undiscernedTrusted,-and damned himself to madness.He spoke of poetry, and how'Divine it was-a light-a love-A spirit which like wind doth blowAs it listeth, to and fro;A dew rained down from God above;'A power which comes and goes like dream,And which none can ever trace-Heaven's light on earth-Truth's brightest beam.'And when he ceased there lay the gleamOf those words upon his face.Now Peter, when he heard such talk,Would, heedless of a broken pate,Stand like a man asleep, or balkSome wishing guest of knife or fork,Or drop and break his master's plate.At night he oft would start and wakeLike a lover, and beganIn a wild measure songs to makeOn moor, and glen, and rocky lake,And on the heart of man-And on the universal sky-And the wide earth's bosom green,-And the sweet, strange mysteryOf what beyond these things may lie,And yet remain unseen.For in his thought he visitedThe spots in which, ere dead and damned,He his wayward life had led;Yet knew not whence the thoughts were fedWhich thus his fancy crammed.And these obscure remembrancesStirred such harmony in Peter,That, whensoever he should please,He could speak of rocks and treesIn poetic metre.For though it was without a senseOf memory, yet he remembered wellMany a ditch and quick-set fence;Of lakes he had intelligence,He knew something of heath and fell.He had also dim recollectionsOf pedlars tramping on their rounds;Milk-pans and pails; and odd collectionsOf saws, and proverbs; and reflectionsOld parsons make in burying-grounds.But Peter's verse was clear, and cameAnnouncing from the frozen hearthOf a cold age, that none might tameThe soul of that diviner flameIt augured to the Earth:Like gentle rains, on the dry plains,Making that green which late was gray,Or like the sudden moon, that stainsSome gloomy chamber's window-panesWith a broad light like day.For language was in Peter's handLike clay while he was yet a potter;And he made songs for all the land,Sweet both to feel and understand,As pipkins late to mountain Cotter.And Mr. --, the bookseller,Gave twenty pounds for some;-then scorningA footman's yellow coat to wear,Peter, too proud of heart, I fear,Instantly gave the Devil warning.Whereat the Devil took offence,And swore in his soul a great oath then,'That for his damned impertinenceHe'd bring him to a proper senseOf what was due to gentlemen!'PART THE SIXTHDAMNATION'O that mine enemy had writtenA book!'-cried Job:-a fearful curse,If to the Arab, as the Briton,'Twas galling to be critic-bitten:-The Devil to Peter wished no worse.When Peter's next new book found vent,The Devil to all the first ReviewsA copy of it slyly sent,With five-pound note as compliment,And this short notice-'Pray abuse.'Then seriatim, month and quarter,Appeared such mad tirades.-One said-'Peter seduced Mrs. Foy's daughter,Then drowned the mother in Ullswater,The last thing as he went to bed.'Another-'Let him shave his head!Where's Dr. Willis?-Or is he joking?What does the rascal mean or hope,No longer imitating Pope,In that barbarian Shakespeare poking?'One more, 'Is incest not enough?And must there be adultery too?Grace after meat? Miscreant and Liar!Thief! Blackguard! Scoundrel! Fool! Hell-fireIs twenty times too good for you.'By that last book of yours we thinkYou've double damned yourself to scorn;We warned you whilst yet on the brinkYou stood. From your black name will shrinkThe babe that is unborn.'All these Reviews the Devil madeUp in a parcel, which he hadSafely to Peter's house conveyed.For carriage, tenpence Peter paid-Untied them-read them-went half mad.'What!' cried he, 'this is my rewardFor nights of thought, and days of toil?Do poets, but to be abhorredBy men of whom they never heard,Consume their spirits' oil?'What have I done to them?-and whoIs Mrs. Foy? 'Tis very cruelTo speak of me and Betty so!Adultery! God defend me! Oh!I've half a mind to fight a duel.'Or,' cried he, a grave look collecting,'Is it my genius, like the moon,Sets those who stand her face inspecting,That face within their brain reflecting,Like a crazed bell-chime, out of tune?'For Peter did not know the town,But thought, as country readers do,For half a guinea or a crown,He bought oblivion or renownFrom God's own voice in a review.All Peter did on this occasionWas, writing some sad stuff in prose.It is a dangerous invasionWhen poets criticize; their stationIs to delight, not pose.The Devil then sent to Leipsic fairFor Born's translation of Kant's book;A world of words, tail foremost, whereRight-wrong-false-true-and foul-and fairAs in a lottery-wheel are shook.Five thousand crammed octavo pagesOf German psychologics,-heWho his furor verborum assuagesThereon, deserves just seven months' wagesMore than will e'er be due to me.I looked on them nine several days,And then I saw that they were bad;A friend, too, spoke in their dispraise,-He never read them;-with amazeI found Sir William Drummond had.When the book came, the Devil sentIt to P. Verbovale, Esquire,With a brief note of compliment,By that night's Carlisle mail. It went,And set his soul on fire.Fire, which ex luce praebens fumum,Made him beyond the bottom seeOf truth's clear well-when I and you, Ma'am,Go, as we shall do, subter humum,We may know more than he.Now Peter ran to seed in soulInto a walking paradox;For he was neither part nor whole,Nor good, nor bad-nor knave nor fool;-Among the woods and rocksFurious he rode, where late he ran,Lashing and spurring his tame hobby;Turned to a formal puritan,A solemn and unsexual man,-He half believed White Obi.This steed in vision he would ride,High trotting over nine-inch bridges,With Flibbertigibbet, imp of pride,Mocking and mowing by his side-A mad-brained goblin for a guide-Over corn-fields, gates, and hedges.After these ghastly rides, he cameHome to his heart, and found from thenceMuch stolen of its accustomed flame;His thoughts grew weak, drowsy, and lameOf their intelligence.To Peter's view, all seemed one hue;He was no Whig, he was no Tory;No Deist and no Christian he;-He got so subtle, that to beNothing, was all his glory.One single point in his beliefFrom his organization sprung,The heart-enrooted faith, the chiefEar in his doctrines' blighted sheaf,That 'Happiness is wrong';So thought Calvin and Dominic;So think their fierce successors, whoEven now would neither stint nor stickOur flesh from off our bones to pick,If they might 'do their do.'His morals thus were undermined:-The old Peter-the hard, old Potter-Was born anew within his mind;He grew dull, harsh, sly, unrefined,As when he tramped beside the Otter.In the death hues of agonyLambently flashing from a fish,Now Peter felt amused to seeShades like a rainbow's rise and flee,Mixed with a certain hungry wish.So in his Country's dying faceHe looked-and, lovely as she lay,Seeking in vain his last embrace,Wailing her own abandoned case,With hardened sneer he turned away:And coolly to his own soul said;-'Do you not think that we might makeA poem on her when she's dead:-Or, no-a thought is in my head-Her shroud for a new sheet I'll take:'My wife wants one.-Let who will buryThis mangled corpse! And I and you,My dearest Soul, will then make merry,As the Prince Regent did with Sherry,-''Ay-and at last desert me too.'And so his Soul would not be gay,But moaned within him; like a fawnMoaning within a cave, it layWounded and wasting, day by day,Till all its life of life was gone.As troubled skies stain waters clear,The storm in Peter's heart and mindNow made his verses dark and queer:They were the ghosts of what they were,Shaking dim grave-clothes in the wind.For he now raved enormous folly,Of Baptisms, Sunday-schools, and Graves,'Twould make George Colman melancholyTo have heard him, like a male Molly,Chanting those stupid staves.Yet the Reviews, who heaped abuseOn Peter while he wrote for freedom,So soon as in his song they spyThe folly which soothes tyranny,Praise him, for those who feed 'em.'He was a man, too great to scan;-A planet lost in truth's keen rays:-His virtue, awful and prodigious;-He was the most sublime, religious,Pure-minded Poet of these days.'As soon as he read that, cried Peter,'Eureka! I have found the wayTo make a better thing of metreThan e'er was made by living creatureUp to this blessèd day.'Then Peter wrote odes to the Devil;-In one of which he meekly said:'May Carnage and Slaughter,Thy niece and thy daughter,May Rapine and Famine,Thy gorge ever cramming,Glut thee with living and dead!'May Death and Damnation,And Consternation,Flit up from Hell with pure intent!Slash them at Manchester,Glasgow, Leeds, and Chester;Drench all with blood from Avon to Trent.'Let thy body-guard yeomenHew down babes and women,And laugh with bold triumph till Heaven be rent!When Moloch in JewryMunched children with fury,It was thou, Devil, dining with pure intent.'PART THE SEVENTHDOUBLE DAMNATIONThe Devil now knew his proper cue.-Soon as he read the ode, he droveTo his friend Lord MacMurderchouse's,A man of interest in both houses,And said:-'For money or for love,'Pray find some cure or sinecure;To feed from the superfluous taxesA friend of ours-a poet-fewerHave fluttered tamer to the lureThan he.' His lordship stands and racks hisStupid brains, while one might countAs many beads as he had boroughs,-At length replies; from his mean front,Like one who rubs out an account,Smoothing away the unmeaning furrows:'It happens fortunately, dear Sir,I can. I hope I need requireNo pledge from you, that he will stirIn our affairs;-like Oliver,That he'll be worthy of his hire.'These words exchanged, the news sent offTo Peter, home the Devil hied,-Took to his bed; he had no cough,No doctor,-meat and drink enough,-Yet that same night he died.The Devil's corpse was leaded down;His decent heirs enjoyed his pelf,Mourning-coaches, many a one,Followed his hearse along the town:-Where was the Devil himself?When Peter heard of his promotion,His eyes grew like two stars for bliss:There was a bow of sleek devotionEngendering in his back; each motionSeemed a Lord's shoe to kiss.He hired a house, bought plate, and madeA genteel drive up to his door,With sifted gravel neatly laid,-As if defying all who said,Peter was ever poor.But a disease soon struck intoThe very life and soul of Peter-He walked about-slept-had the hueOf health upon his cheeks-and fewDug better-none a heartier eater.And yet a strange and horrid curseClung upon Peter, night and day;Month after month the thing grew worse,And deadlier than in this my verseI can find strength to say.Peter was dull-he was at firstDull-oh, so dull-so very dull!Whether he talked, wrote, or rehearsed-Still with this dulness was he cursed-Dull-beyond all conception-dull.No one could read his books-no mortal,But a few natural friends, would hear him;The parson came not near his portal;His state was like that of the immortalDescribed by Swift-no man could bear him.His sister, wife, and children yawned,With a long, slow, and drear ennui,All human patience far beyond;Their hopes of Heaven each would have pawned,Anywhere else to be.But in his verse, and in his prose,The essence of his dulness wasConcentred and compressed so close,'Twould have made Guatimozin dozeOn his red gridiron of brass.A printer's boy, folding those pages,Fell slumbrously upon one side;Like those famed Seven who slept three ages.To wakeful frenzy's vigil-rages,As opiates, were the same applied.Even the Reviewers who were hiredTo do the work of his reviewing,With adamantine nerves, grew tired;-Gaping and torpid they retired,To dream of what they should be doing.And worse and worse, the drowsy curseYawned in him, till it grew a pest-A wide contagious atmosphere,Creeping like cold through all things near;A power to infect and to infest.His servant-maids and dogs grew dull;His kitten, late a sportive elf;The woods and lakes, so beautiful,Of dim stupidity were full,All grew dull as Peter's self.The earth under his feet-the springs,Which lived within it a quick life,The air, the winds of many wings,That fan it with new murmurings,Were dead to their harmonious strife.The birds and beasts within the wood,The insects, and each creeping thing,Were now a silent multitude;Love's work was left unwrought-no broodNear Peter's house took wing.And every neighbouring cottagerStupidly yawned upon the other:No jackass brayed; no little curCocked up his ears;-no man would stirTo save a dying mother.Yet all from that charmed district wentBut some half-idiot and half-knave,Who rather than pay any rent,Would live with marvellous content,Over his father's grave.No bailiff dared within that space,For fear of the dull charm, to enter;A man would bear upon his face,For fifteen months in any case,The yawn of such a venture.Seven miles above-below-around-This pest of dulness holds its sway;A ghastly life without a sound;To Peter's soul the spell is bound-How should it ever pass away?

Gloomy troopsOf sentinels in stern and silent ranksEncompass it around; the dweller thereCannot be free and happy; hearest thou notThe curses of the fatherless, the groansOf those who have no friend? He passes on-The King, the wearer of a gilded chainThat binds his soul to abjectness, the foolWhom courtiers nickname monarch, whilst a slaveEven to the basest appetites-that manHeeds not the shriek of penury; he smilesAt the deep curses which the destituteMutter in secret, and a sullen joyPervades his bloodless heart when thousands groanBut for those morsels which his wantonnessWastes in unjoyous revelry, to saveAll that they love from famine; when he hearsThe tale of horror, to some ready-made faceOf hypocritical assent he turns,Smothering the glow of shame, that, spite of him,Flushes his bloated cheek.Now to the mealOf silence, grandeur and excess he dragsHis palled unwilling appetite. If gold,Gleaming around, and numerous viands culledFrom every clime could force the loathing senseTo overcome satiety,-if wealthThe spring it draws from poisons not,-or vice,Unfeeling, stubborn vice, converteth notIts food to deadliest venom; then that kingIs happy; and the peasant who fulfilsHis unforced task, when he returns at evenAnd by the blazing fagot meets againHer welcome for whom all his toil is sped,Tastes not a sweeter meal.Behold him nowStretched on the gorgeous couch; his fevered brainReels dizzily awhile; but ah! too soonThe slumber of intemperance subsides,And conscience, that undying serpent, callsHer venomous brood to their nocturnal task.Listen! he speaks! oh! mark that frenzied eye-Oh! mark that deadly visage!'KING'No cessation!Oh! must this last forever!

Hark! yet he mutters;His slumbers are but varied agonies;They prey like scorpions on the springs of life.There needeth not the hell that bigots frameTo punish those who err; earth in itselfContains at once the evil and the cure;And all-sufficing Nature can chastiseThose who transgress her law; she only knowsHow justly to proportion to the faultThe punishment it merits.Is it strangeThat this poor wretch should pride him in his woe?Take pleasure in his abjectness, and hugThe scorpion that consumes him? Is it strangeThat, placed on a conspicuous throne of thorns,Grasping an iron sceptre, and immuredWithin a splendid prison whose stern boundsShut him from all that's good or dear on earth,His soul asserts not its humanity?That man's mild nature rises not in warAgainst a king's employ? No-'tis not strange.He, like the vulgar, thinks, feels, acts, and livesJust as his father did; the unconquered powersOf precedent and custom interposeBetween a king and virtue. Stranger yet,To those who know not Nature nor deduceThe future from the present, it may seem,That not one slave, who suffers from the crimesOf this unnatural being, not one wretch,Whose children famish and whose nuptial bedIs earth's unpitying bosom, rears an armTo dash him from his throne!Those gilded fliesThat, basking in the sunshine of a court,Fatten on its corruption! what are they?-The drones of the community; they feedOn the mechanic's labor; the starved hind For them compels the stubborn glebe to yieldIts unshared harvests; and yon squalid form,Leaner than fleshless misery, that wastesA sunless life in the unwholesome mine,Drags out in labor a protracted deathTo glut their grandeur; many faint with toilThat few may know the cares and woe of sloth.Whence, thinkest thou, kings and parasites arose?Whence that unnatural line of drones who heapToil and unvanquishable penury On those who build their palaces and bringTheir daily bread?-From vice, black loathsome vice;From rapine, madness, treachery, and wrong;From all that genders misery, and makesOf earth this thorny wilderness; from lust,Revenge, and murder.-And when reason's voice,Loud as the voice of Nature, shall have wakedThe nations; and mankind perceive that viceIs discord, war and misery; that virtueIs peace and happiness and harmony; When man's maturer nature shall disdainThe playthings of its childhood;-kingly glareWill lose its power to dazzle, its authorityWill silently pass by; the gorgeous throneShall stand unnoticed in the regal hall,Fast falling to decay; whilst falsehood's tradeShall be as hateful and unprofitableAs that of truth is now.Where is the fameWhich the vain-glorious mighty of the earthSeek to eternize? Oh! the faintest soundFrom time's light footfall, the minutest waveThat swells the flood of ages, whelms in nothingThe unsubstantial bubble. Ay! to-dayStern is the tyrant's mandate, red the gazeThat flashes desolation, strong the armThat scatters multitudes. To-morrow comes!That mandate is a thunder-peal that diedIn ages past; that gaze, a transient flashOn which the midnight closed; and on that armThe worm has made his meal.The virtuous man,Who, great in his humility as kingsAre little in their grandeur; he who leadsInvincibly a life of resolute goodAnd stands amid the silent dungeon-depthsMore free and fearless than the trembling judgeWho, clothed in venal power, vainly stroveTo bind the impassive spirit;-when he falls,His mild eye beams benevolence no more;Withered the hand outstretched but to relieve;Sunk reason's simple eloquence that rolled But to appall the guilty. Yes! the graveHath quenched that eye and death's relentless frostWithered that arm; but the unfading fameWhich virtue hangs upon its votary's tomb,The deathless memory of that man whom kingsCall to their minds and tremble, the remembranceWith which the happy spirit contemplatesIts well-spent pilgrimage on earth,Shall never pass away.'Nature rejects the monarch, not the man;The subject, not the citizen; for kingsAnd subjects, mutual foes, forever playA losing game into each other's hands,Whose stakes are vice and misery. The manOf virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys.Power, like a desolating pestilence,Pollutes whate'er it touches; and obedience,Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,Makes slaves of men, and of the human frameA mechanized automaton.When Nero High over flaming Rome with savage joyLowered like a fiend, drank with enraptured earThe shrieks of agonizing death, beheldThe frightful desolation spread, and feltA new-created sense within his soulThrill to the sight and vibrate to the sound,-Thinkest thou his grandeur had not overcomeThe force of human kindness? And when RomeWith one stern blow hurled not the tyrant down,Crushed not the arm red with her dearest blood,Had not submissive abjectness destroyedNature's suggestions?Look on yonder earth:The golden harvests spring; the unfailing sunSheds light and life; the fruits, the flowers, the trees,Arise in due succession; all things speakPeace, harmony and love. The universe,In Nature's silent eloquence, declaresThat all fulfil the works of love and joy,-All but the outcast, Man. He fabricatesThe sword which stabs his peace; he cherishethThe snakes that gnaw his heart; he raiseth upThe tyrant whose delight is in his woe,Whose sport is in his agony. Yon sun,Lights it the great alone? Yon silver beams,Sleep they less sweetly on the cottage thatchThan on the dome of kings? Is mother earthA step-dame to her numerous sons who earnHer unshared gifts with unremitting toil;A mother only to those puling babesWho, nursed in ease and luxury, make menThe playthings of their babyhood and marIn self-important childishness that peaceWhich men alone appreciate?'Spirit of Nature, no!The pure diffusion of thy essence throbsAlike in every human heart.Thou aye erectest thereThy throne of power unappealable;Thou art the judge beneath whose nodMan's brief and frail authority Is powerless as the windThat passeth idly by;Thine the tribunal which surpassethThe show of human justiceAs God surpasses man!'Spirit of Nature! thouLife of interminable multitudes;Soul of those mighty spheresWhose changeless paths through Heaven's deep silence lie;Soul of that smallest being,The dwelling of whose lifeIs one faint April sun-gleam;-Man, like these passive things,Thy will unconsciously fulfilleth;Like theirs, his age of endless peace,Which time is fast maturing,Will swiftly, surely, come;And the unbounded frame which thou pervadest,Will be without a flawMarring its perfect symmetry!

Queen Mab: Part Iv.,"                        'How beautiful this night! the balmiest sigh,Which vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear,Were discord to the speaking quietudeThat wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault,Studded with stars unutterably bright,Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,Seems like a canopy which love had spreadTo curtain her sleeping world. Yon gentle hills.Robed in a garment of untrodden snow;Yon darksome rocks, whence icicles dependSo stainless that their white and glittering spiresTinge not the moon's pure beam; yon castled steepWhose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn towerSo idly that rapt fancy deemeth itA metaphor of peace;-all form a sceneWhere musing solitude might love to liftHer soul above this sphere of earthliness;Where silence undisturbed might watch alone-So cold, so bright, so still.The orb of dayIn southern climes o'er ocean's waveless fieldSinks sweetly smiling; not the faintest breathSteals o'er the unruffled deep; the clouds of eveReflect unmoved the lingering beam of day;And Vesper's image on the western mainIs beautifully still. To-morrow comes:Cloud upon cloud, in dark and deepening mass,Roll o'er the blackened waters; the deep roarOf distant thunder mutters awfully;Tempest unfolds its pinion o'er the gloomThat shrouds the boiling surge; the pitiless fiend,With all his winds and lightnings, tracks his prey;The torn deep yawns,-the vessel finds a graveBeneath its jagged gulf.Ah! whence yon glareThat fires the arch of heaven? that dark red smokeBlotting the silver moon? The stars are quenchedIn darkness, and the pure and spangling snowGleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round.Hark to that roar whose swift and deafening pealsIn countless echoes through the mountains ring,Startling pale Midnight on her starry throne! Now swells the intermingling din; the jarFrequent and frightful of the bursting bomb;The falling beam, the shriek, the groan, the shout,The ceaseless clangor, and the rush of menInebriate with rage:-loud and more loudThe discord grows; till pale Death shuts the sceneAnd o'er the conqueror and the conquered drawsHis cold and bloody shroud.-Of all the menWhom day's departing beam saw blooming thereIn proud and vigorous health; of all the hearts That beat with anxious life at sunset there;How few survive, how few are beating now!All is deep silence, like the fearful calmThat slumbers in the storm's portentous pause;Save when the frantic wail of widowed loveComes shuddering on the blast, or the faint moanWith which some soul bursts from the frame of clayWrapt round its struggling powers.The gray mornDawns on the mournful scene; the sulphurous smokeBefore the icy wind slow rolls away, And the bright beams of frosty morning danceAlong the spangling snow. There tracks of bloodEven to the forest's depth, and scattered arms,And lifeless warriors, whose hard lineamentsDeath's self could change not, mark the dreadful pathOf the outsallying victors; far behindBlack ashes note where their proud city stood.Within yon forest is a gloomy glen-Each tree which guards its darkness from the day,Waves o'er a warrior's tomb.I see thee shrink, Surpassing Spirit!-wert thou human else?I see a shade of doubt and horror fleetAcross thy stainless features; yet fear not;This is no unconnected misery,Nor stands uncaused and irretrievable.Man's evil nature, that apologyWhich kings who rule, and cowards who crouch, set upFor their unnumbered crimes, sheds not the bloodWhich desolates the discord-wasted land.From kings and priests and statesmen war arose,Whose safety is man's deep unbettered woe,Whose grandeur his debasement. Let the axeStrike at the root, the poison-tree will fall;And where its venomed exhalations spreadRuin, and death, and woe, where millions layQuenching the serpent's famine, and their bonesBleaching unburied in the putrid blast,A garden shall arise, in lovelinessSurpassing fabled Eden.Hath Nature's soul,-That formed this world so beautiful, that spread Earth's lap with plenty, and life's smallest chordStrung to unchanging unison, that gaveThe happy birds their dwelling in the grove,That yielded to the wanderers of the deepThe lovely silence of the unfathomed main,And filled the meanest worm that crawls in dustWith spirit, thought and love,-on Man alone,Partial in causeless malice, wantonlyHeaped ruin, vice, and slavery; his soulBlasted with withering curses; placed afar The meteor-happiness, that shuns his grasp,But serving on the frightful gulf to glareRent wide beneath his footsteps?Nature!-no!Kings, priests and statesmen blast the human flowerEven in its tender bud; their influence dartsLike subtle poison through the bloodless veinsOf desolate society. The child,Ere he can lisp his mother's sacred name,Swells with the unnatural pride of crime, and liftsHis baby-sword even in a hero's mood. This infant arm becomes the bloodiest scourgeOf devastated earth; whilst specious names,Learnt in soft childhood's unsuspecting hour,Serve as the sophisms with which manhood dimsBright reason's ray and sanctifies the swordUpraised to shed a brother's innocent blood.Let priest-led slaves cease to proclaim that manInherits vice and misery, when forceAnd falsehood hang even o'er the cradled babe,Stifling with rudest grasp all natural good. 'Ah! to the stranger-soul, when first it peepsFrom its new tenement and looks abroadFor happiness and sympathy, how sternAnd desolate a tract is this wide world!How withered all the buds of natural good!No shade, no shelter from the sweeping stormsOf pitiless power! On its wretched framePoisoned, perchance, by the disease and woeHeaped on the wretched parent whence it sprungBy morals, law and custom, the pure winds Of heaven, that renovate the insect tribes,May breathe not. The untainting light of dayMay visit not its longings. It is boundEre it has life; yea, all the chains are forgedLong ere its being; all liberty and loveAnd peace is torn from its defencelessness;Cursed from its birth, even from its cradle doomedTo abjectness and bondage!'Throughout this varied and eternal worldSoul is the only element, the block That for uncounted ages has remained.The moveless pillar of a mountain's weightIs active living spirit. Every grainIs sentient both in unity and part,And the minutest atom comprehendsA world of loves and hatreds; these begetEvil and good; hence truth and falsehood spring;Hence will and thought and action, all the germsOf pain or pleasure, sympathy or hate,That variegate the eternal universe.Soul is not more polluted than the beamsOf heaven's pure orb ere round their rapid linesThe taint of earth-born atmospheres arise.'Man is of soul and body, formed for deedsOf high resolve; on fancy's boldest wingTo soar unwearied, fearlessly to turnThe keenest pangs to peacefulness, and tasteThe joys which mingled sense and spirit yield;Or he is formed for abjectness and woe,To grovel on the dunghill of his fears, To shrink at every sound, to quench the flameOf natural love in sensualism, to knowThat hour as blest when on his worthless daysThe frozen hand of death shall set its seal,Yet fear the cure, though hating the disease.The one is man that shall hereafter be;The other, man as vice has made him now.'War is the statesman's game, the priest's delight,The lawyer's jest, the hired assassin's trade,And to those royal murderers whose mean thrones Are bought by crimes of treachery and gore,The bread they eat, the staff on which they lean.Guards, garbed in blood-red livery, surroundTheir palaces, participate the crimesThat force defends and from a nation's rageSecures the crown, which all the curses reachThat famine, frenzy, woe and penury breathe.These are the hired bravos who defendThe tyrant's throne-the bullies of his fear;These are the sinks and channels of worst vice,The refuse of society, the dregsOf all that is most vile; their cold hearts blendDeceit with sternness, ignorance with pride,All that is mean and villainous with rageWhich hopelessness of good and self-contemptAlone might kindle; they are decked in wealth,Honor and power, then are sent abroadTo do their work. The pestilence that stalksIn gloomy triumph through some eastern landIs less destroying. They cajole with goldAnd promises of fame the thoughtless youthAlready crushed with servitude; he knowsHis wretchedness too late, and cherishesRepentance for his ruin, when his doomIs sealed in gold and blood!Those too the tyrant serve, who, skilled to snareThe feet of justice in the toils of law,Stand ready to oppress the weaker still,And right or wrong will vindicate for gold,Sneering at public virtue, which beneath Their pitiless tread lies torn and trampled whereHonor sits smiling at the sale of truth.'Then grave and hoary-headed hypocrites,Without a hope, a passion or a love,Who through a life of luxury and liesHave crept by flattery to the seats of power,Support the system whence their honors flow.They have three words-well tyrants know their use,Well pay them for the loan with usuryTorn from a bleeding world!-God, Hell and Heaven:A vengeful, pitiless, and almighty fiend,Whose mercy is a nickname for the rageOf tameless tigers hungering for blood;Hell, a red gulf of everlasting fire,Where poisonous and undying worms prolongEternal misery to those hapless slavesWhose life has been a penance for its crimes;And Heaven, a meed for those who dare belieTheir human nature, quake, believe and cringeBefore the mockeries of earthly power. 'These tools the tyrant tempers to his work,Wields in his wrath, and as he wills destroys,Omnipotent in wickedness; the whileYouth springs, age moulders, manhood tamely doesHis bidding, bribed by short-lived joys to lendForce to the weakness of his trembling arm.They rise, they fall; one generation comesYielding its harvest to destruction's scythe.It fades, another blossoms; yet behold!Red glows the tyrant's stamp-mark on its bloom,Withering and cankering deep its passive prime.He has invented lying words and modes,Empty and vain as his own coreless heart;Evasive meanings, nothings of much sound,To lure the heedless victim to the toilsSpread round the valley of its paradise.'Look to thyself, priest, conqueror or prince!Whether thy trade is falsehood, and thy lustsDeep wallow in the earnings of the poor,With whom thy master was; or thou delight'stIn numbering o'er the myriads of thy slain,All misery weighing nothing in the scaleAgainst thy short-lived fame; or thou dost loadWith cowardice and crime the groaning land,A pomp-fed king. Look to thy wretched self!Ay, art thou not the veriest slave that e'erCrawled on the loathing earth? Are not thy daysDays of unsatisfying listlessness?Dost thou not cry, ere night's long rack is o'er,'When will the morning come?' Is not thy youth A vain and feverish dream of sensualism?Thy manhood blighted with unripe disease?Are not thy views of unregretted deathDrear, comfortless and horrible? Thy mind,Is it not morbid as thy nerveless frame,Incapable of judgment, hope or love?And dost thou wish the errors to survive,That bar thee from all sympathies of good,After the miserable interestThou hold'st in their protraction? When the grave Has swallowed up thy memory and thyself,Dost thou desire the bane that poisons earthTo twine its roots around thy coffined clay,Spring from thy bones, and blossom on thy tomb,That of its fruit thy babes may eat and die?

'Fierce the avenging Demon's ire,Fiercer than the wintry blast,Fiercer than the lightning's fire,When the hour of twilight's past'--The warrior raised his sunken eye. It met the stranger's sullen scowl,'Mortal! Mortal! thou must die,'In burning letters chilled his soul.WARRIOR:Stranger! whoso'er you are,I feel impelled my tale to tell--Horrors stranger shalt thou hear,Horrors drear as those of Hell.O'er my Castle silence reigned,Late the night and drear the hour,When on the terrace I observed,A fleeting shadowy mist to lower.--Light the cloud as summer fog,Which transient shuns the morning beam;Fleeting as the cloud on bog,That hangs or on the mountain stream.--Horror seized my shuddering brain,Horror dimmed my starting eye.In vain I tried to speak,--In vainMy limbs essayed the spot to fly--At last the thin and shadowy form,With noiseless, trackless footsteps came,--Its light robe floated on the storm,Its head was bound with lambent flame.In chilling voice drear as the breezeWhich sweeps along th' autumnal ground, Which wanders through the leafless trees,Or the mandrake's groan which floats around.'Thou art mine and I am thine,'Till the sinking of the world,I am thine and thou art mine, 'Till in ruin death is hurled--'Strong the power and dire the fate,Which drags me from the depths of Hell,Breaks the tomb's eternal gate,Where fiendish shapes and dead men yell,'Haply I might ne'er have shrankFrom flames that rack the guilty dead,Haply I might ne'er have sankOn pleasure's flowery, thorny bed----'But stay! no more I dare disclose,Of the tale I wish to tell,On Earth relentless were my woes,But fiercer are my pangs in Hell--'Now I claim thee as my love,Lay aside all chilling fear, My affection will I prove,Where sheeted ghosts and spectres are!'For thou art mine, and I am thine,'Till the dreaded judgement day,I am thine, and thou art mine--Night is past--I must away.'Still I gazed, and still the formPressed upon my aching sight,Still I braved the howling storm,When the ghost dissolved in night.--Restless, sleepless fled the night,Sleepless as a sick man’s bed,When he sighs for morning light,When he turns his aching head,--Slow and painful passed the day. Melancholy seized my brain,Lingering fled the hours away,Lingering to a wretch in pain.--At last came night, ah! horrid hour,Ah! chilling time that wakes the dead,When demons ride the clouds that lower,--The phantom sat upon my bed.In hollow voice, low as the soundWhich in some charnel makes its moan,What floats along the burying ground,The phantom claimed me as her own.Her chilling finger on my head,With coldest touch congealed my soul--Cold as the finger of the dead,Or damps which round a tombstone roll--Months are passed in lingering round,Every night the spectre comes,With thrilling step it shakes the ground,With thrilling step it round me roams--Stranger! I have told to thee,All the tale I have to tell--Stranger! canst thou tell to me,How to ‘scape the powers of Hell?--STRANGER:Warrior! I can ease thy woes,Wilt thou, wilt thou, come with me--Warrior! I can all disclose,Follow, follow, follow me.Yet the tempest's duskiest wing,Its mantle stretches o'er the sky,Yet the midnight ravens sing, 'Mortal! Mortal! thou must die.'At last they saw a river clear,That crossed the heathy path they trod,The Stranger’s look was wild and drear,The firm Earth shook beneath his nod--He raised a wand above his head,He traced a circle on the plain,In a wild verse he called the dead,The dead with silent footsteps came.A burning brilliance on his head, Flaming filled the stormy air,In a wild verse he called the dead,The dead in motley crowd were there.--'Ghasta! Ghasta! come along,Bring thy fiendish crowd with thee,Quickly raise th' avenging Song,Ghasta! Ghasta! come to me.'Horrid shapes in mantles gray,Flit athwart the stormy night,'Ghasta! Ghasta! come away,Come away before 'tis light.'See! the sheeted Ghost they bring,Yelling dreadful o’er the heath,Hark! the deadly verse they sing,Tidings of despair and death! The yelling Ghost before him stands,See! she rolls her eyes around,Now she lifts her bony hands,Now her footsteps shake the ground.STRANGER:Phantom of Theresa say,Why to earth again you came,Quickly speak, I must away!Or you must bleach for aye in flame,--PHANTOM:Mighty one I know thee now,Mightiest power of the sky, Know thee by thy flaming brow,Know thee by thy sparkling eye.That fire is scorching! Oh! I came,From the caverned depth of Hell,My fleeting false Rodolph to claim,Mighty one! I know thee well.--STRANGER:Ghasta! seize yon wandering sprite,Drag her to the depth beneath,Take her swift, before 'tis light,Take her to the cells of death! Thou that heardst the trackless dead,In the mouldering tomb must lie,Mortal! look upon my head,Mortal! Mortal! thou must die.Of glowing flame a cross was there, Which threw a light around his form,Whilst his lank and raven hair,Floated wild upon the storm.--The warrior upwards turned his eyes,Gazed upon the cross of fire, There sat horror and surprise,There sat God’s eternal ire.--A shivering through the Warrior flew,Colder than the nightly blast,Colder than the evening dew, When the hour of twilight’s past.--Thunder shakes th' expansive sky,Shakes the bosom of the heath,'Mortal! Mortal! thou must die'--The warrior sank convulsed in death. JANUARY, 1810.                                             "

Song. Despair,"                        Ask not the pallid stranger's woe,With beating heart and throbbing breast,Whose step is faltering, weak, and slow,As though the body needed rest.--Whose 'wildered eye no object meets, Nor cares to ken a friendly glance,With silent grief his bosom beats,--Now fixed, as in a deathlike trance.Who looks around with fearful eye,And shuns all converse with man kind, As though some one his griefs might spy,And soothe them with a kindred mind.A friend or foe to him the same,He looks on each with equal eye;The difference lies but in the name, To none for comfort can he fly.--'Twas deep despair, and sorrow’s trace,To him too keenly given,Whose memory, time could not efface--His peace was lodged in Heaven.--He looks on all this world bestows,The pride and pomp of power,As trifles best for pageant showsWhich vanish in an hour.When torn is dear affection's tie,Sinks the soft heart full low;It leaves without a parting sigh,All that these realms bestow.JUNE, 1810.

Homer's Hymn To The Earth: Mother Of All,"                        O universal Mother, who dost keepFrom everlasting thy foundations deep,Eldest of things, Great Earth, I sing of thee!All shapes that have their dwelling in the sea,All things that fly, or on the ground divine Live, move, and there are nourished—these are thine;These from thy wealth thou dost sustain; from theeFair babes are born, and fruits on every treeHang ripe and large, revered Divinity!The life of mortal men beneath thy sway Is held; thy power both gives and takes away!Happy are they whom thy mild favours nourish;All things unstinted round them grow and flourish.For them, endures the life-sustaining fieldIts load of harvest, and their cattle yield Large increase, and their house with wealth is filled.Such honoured dwell in cities fair and free,The homes of lovely women, prosperously;Their sons exult in youth’s new budding gladness,And their fresh daughters free from care or sadness, With bloom-inwoven dance and happy song,On the soft flowers the meadow-grass among,Leap round them sporting--such delights by theeAre given, rich Power, revered Divinity.Mother of gods, thou Wife of starry Heaven,Farewell! be thou propitious, and be givenA happy life for this brief melody,Nor thou nor other songs shall unremembered be.

Hymn Of Apollo,"                        I.The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie,Curtained with star-inwoven tapestries,From the broad moonlight of the sky,Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes,--Waken me when their Mother, the gray Dawn,Tells them that dreams and that the moon is gone.II.Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,I walk over the mountains and the waves,Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the cavesAre filled with my bright presence, and the airLeaves the green Earth to my embraces bare.III.The sunbeams are my shafts, with which I killDeceit, that loves the night and fears the day;All men who do or even imagine illFly me, and from the glory of my rayGood minds and open actions take new might,Until diminished by the reign of Night.IV.I feed the clouds, the rainbows, and the flowers,With their ethereal colors; the Moon's globe,And the pure stars in their eternal bowers,Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine,Are portions of one power, which is mine.V.I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven;Then with unwilling steps I wander downInto the clouds of the Atlantic even;For grief that I depart they weep and frown:What look is more delightful than the smileWith which I soothe them from the western isle?VI.I am the eye with which the UniverseBeholds itself, and knows it is divine;All harmony of instrument or verse,All prophecy, all medicine, is mine,All light of art or nature; - to my songVictory and praise in its own right belong.

Love,"                        Why is it said thou canst not liveIn a youthful breast and fair,Since thou eternal life canst give,Canst bloom for ever there?Since withering pain no power possessed, Nor age, to blanch thy vermeil hue,Nor time's dread victor, death, confessed,Though bathed with his poison dew,Still thou retain'st unchanging bloom,Fixed tranquil, even in the tomb. And oh! when on the blest, reviving,The day-star dawns of love,Each energy of soul survivingMore vivid, soars above,Hast thou ne'er felt a rapturous thrill, Like June's warm breath, athwart thee fly,O'er each idea then to steal,When other passions die?Felt it in some wild noonday dream,When sitting by the lonely stream, Where Silence says, 'Mine is the dell';And not a murmur from the plain,And not an echo from the fell,Disputes her silent reign.

War,"                        Ambition, power, and avarice, now have hurledDeath, fate, and ruin, on a bleeding world.See! on yon heath what countless victims lie,Hark! what loud shrieks ascend through yonder sky;Tell then the cause, 'tis sure the avenger's rage Has swept these myriads from life's crowded stage:Hark to that groan, an anguished hero dies,He shudders in death’s latest agonies;Yet does a fleeting hectic flush his cheek,Yet does his parting breath essay to speak--'Oh God! my wife, my children--Monarch thouFor whose support this fainting frame lies low;For whose support in distant lands I bleed,Let his friends' welfare be the warrior's meed.He hears me not—ah! no—kings cannot hear, For passion's voice has dulled their listless ear.To thee, then, mighty God, I lift my moan,Thou wilt not scorn a suppliant's anguished groan.Oh! now I die--but still is death's fierce pain--God hears my prayer--we meet, we meet again.'He spake, reclined him on death's bloody bed,And with a parting groan his spirit fled.Oppressors of mankind to YOU we oweThe baleful streams from whence these miseries flow;For you how many a mother weeps her son, Snatched from life's course ere half his race was run!For you how many a widow drops a tear,In silent anguish, on her husband's bier!'Is it then Thine, Almighty Power,' she cries,'Whence tears of endless sorrow dim these eyes?Is this the system which Thy powerful sway,Which else in shapeless chaos sleeping lay,Formed and approved?--it cannot be--but oh!Forgive me, Heaven, my brain is warped by woe.''Tis not--He never bade the war-note swell, He never triumphed in the work of hell--Monarchs of earth! thine is the baleful deed,Thine are the crimes for which thy subjects bleed.Ah! when will come the sacred fated time,When man unsullied by his leaders' crime,Despising wealth, ambition, pomp, and pride,Will stretch him fearless by his foe-men's side?Ah! when will come the time, when o'er the plainNo more shall death and desolation reign?When will the sun smile on the bloodless field, And the stern warrior's arm the sickle wield?Not whilst some King, in cold ambition's dreams,Plans for the field of death his plodding schemes;Not whilst for private pique the public fall,And one frail mortal's mandate governs all. Swelled with command and mad with dizzying sway;Who sees unmoved his myriads fade away.Careless who lives or dies--so that he gainsSome trivial point for which he took the pains.What then are Kings?--I see the trembling crowd, I hear their fulsome clamours echoed loud;Their stern oppressor pleased appears awhile,But April's sunshine is a Monarch’s smile--Kings are but dust--the last eventful dayWill level all and make them lose their sway; Will dash the sceptre from the Monarch’s hand,And from the warrior’s grasp wrest the ensanguined brand.Oh! Peace, soft Peace, art thou for ever gone,Is thy fair form indeed for ever flown?And love and concord hast thou swept away, As if incongruous with thy parted sway?Alas, I fear thou hast, for none appear.Now o'er the palsied earth stalks giant Fear,With War, and Woe, and Terror, in his train;--List'ning he pauses on the embattled plain,Then speeding swiftly o'er the ensanguined heath,Has left the frightful work to Hell and Death.See! gory Ruin yokes his blood-stained car,He scents the battle's carnage from afar;Hell and Destruction mark his mad career, He tracks the rapid step of hurrying Fear;Whilst ruined towns and smoking cities tell,That thy work, Monarch, is the work of Hell.'It is thy work!' I hear a voice repeat,Shakes the broad basis of thy bloodstained seat; And at the orphan’s sigh, the widow's moan,Totters the fabric of thy guilt-stained throne--'It is thy work, O Monarch;' now the soundFainter and fainter, yet is borne around,Yet to enthusiast ears the murmurs tellThat Heaven, indignant at the work of Hell,Will soon the cause, the hated cause remove,Which tears from earth peace, innocence, and love.

Summer And Winter,"                        It was a bright and cheerful afternoon,Towards the end of the sunny month of June,When the north wind congregates in crowdsThe floating mountains of the silver cloudsFrom the horizon—and the stainless sky Opens beyond them like eternity.All things rejoiced beneath the sun; the weeds,The river, and the corn-fields, and the reeds;The willow leaves that glanced in the light breeze,And the firm foliage of the larger trees. It was a winter such as when birds dieIn the deep forests; and the fishes lieStiffened in the translucent ice, which makesEven the mud and slime of the warm lakesA wrinkled clod as hard as brick; and when, Among their children, comfortable menGather about great fires, and yet feel cold:Alas, then, for the homeless beggar old!

Your sons, your wives, your brethren, were they;Who said they were slain on the battle day?Awaken, awaken, awaken!The slave and the tyrant are twin-born foes;Be the cold chains shaken To the dust where your kindred repose, repose:Their bones in the grave will start and move,When they hear the voices of those they love,Most loud in the holy combat above.Wave, wave high the banner! When Freedom is riding to conquest by:Though the slaves that fan herBe Famine and Toil, giving sigh for sigh.And ye who attend her imperial car,Lift not your hands in the banded war, But in her defence whose children ye are.Glory, glory, glory,To those who have greatly suffered and done!Never name in storyWas greater than that which ye shall have won. Conquerors have conquered their foes alone,Whose revenge, pride, and power they have overthrownRide ye, more victorious, over your own.Bind, bind every browWith crownals of violet, ivy, and pine:Hide the blood-stains nowWith hues which sweet Nature has made divine:Green strength, azure hope, and eternity:But let not the pansy among them be;Ye were injured, and that means memory.

Lines Written In The Bay Of Lerici,"                            She left me at the silent time     When the moon had ceas'd to climb    The azure path of Heaven's steep,    And like an albatross asleep,    Balanc'd on her wings of light,    Hover'd in the purple night,    Ere she sought her ocean nest    In the chambers of the West.    She left me, and I stay'd alone  Thinking over every tone  Which, though silent to the ear,  The enchanted heart could hear,  Like notes which die when born, but still  Haunt the echoes of the hill;  And feeling ever--oh, too much!--  The soft vibration of her touch,  As if her gentle hand, even now,  Lightly trembled on my brow;  And thus, although she absent were,  Memory gave me all of her  That even Fancy dares to claim:  Her presence had made weak and tame  All passions, and I lived alone  In the time which is our own;  The past and future were forgot,  As they had been, and would be, not.  But soon, the guardian angel gone,  The daemon reassum'd his throne  In my faint heart. I dare not speak  My thoughts, but thus disturb'd and weak  I sat and saw the vessels glide  Over the ocean bright and wide,  Like spirit-winged chariots sent  O'er some serenest element  For ministrations strange and far,  As if to some Elysian star  Sailed for drink to medicine  Such sweet and bitter pain as mine.  And the wind that wing'd their flight  From the land came fresh and light,  And the scent of winged flowers,  And the coolness of the hours  Of dew, and sweet warmth left by day,  Were scatter'd o'er the twinkling bay.  And the fisher with his lamp  And spear about the low rocks damp  Crept, and struck the fish which came  To worship the delusive flame.  Too happy they, whose pleasure sought  Extinguishes all sense and thought  Of the regret that pleasure leaves,  Destroying life alone, not peace!                                             "

Julian And Maddalo (Excerpt),"                            I rode one evening with Count Maddalo     Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow    Of Adria towards Venice: a bare strand    Of hillocks, heap'd from ever-shifting sand,    Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,    Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds,    Is this; an uninhabited sea-side,    Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,    Abandons; and no other object breaks  The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes  Broken and unrepair'd, and the tide makes  A narrow space of level sand thereon,  Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down.  This ride was my delight. I love all waste  And solitary places; where we taste  The pleasure of believing what we see  Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be:  And such was this wide ocean, and this shore  More barren than its billows; and yet more  Than all, with a remember'd friend I love  To ride as then I rode; for the winds drove  The living spray along the sunny air  Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,  Stripp'd to their depths by the awakening north;  And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth  Harmonizing with solitude, and sent  Into our hearts aëreal merriment.  So, as we rode, we talk'd; and the swift thought,  Winging itself with laughter, linger'd not,  But flew from brain to brain--such glee was ours,  Charg'd with light memories of remember'd hours,  None slow enough for sadness: till we came  Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.  This day had been cheerful but cold, and now  The sun was sinking, and the wind also.  Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be  Talk interrupted with such raillery  As mocks itself, because it cannot scorn  The thoughts it would extinguish: 'twas forlorn,  Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets tell,  The devils held within the dales of Hell  Concerning God, freewill and destiny:  Of all that earth has been or yet may be,  All that vain men imagine or believe,  Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve,  We descanted, and I (for ever still  Is it not wise to make the best of ill?)  Argu'd against despondency, but pride  Made my companion take the darker side.  The sense that he was greater than his kind  Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind  By gazing on its own exceeding light.  Meanwhile the sun paus'd ere it should alight,  Over the horizon of the mountains--Oh,  How beautiful is sunset, when the glow  Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee,  Thou Paradise of exiles, Italy!  Thy mountains, seas, and vineyards, and the towers  Of cities they encircle! It was ours    To stand on thee, beholding it: and then,  Just where we had dismounted, the Count's men  Were waiting for us with the gondola.  As those who pause on some delightful way  Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stood  Looking upon the evening, and the flood  Which lay between the city and the shore,  Pav'd with the image of the sky.... The hoar  And aëry Alps towards the North appear'd  Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark rear'd  Between the East and West; and half the sky  Was roof'd with clouds of rich emblazonry  Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew  Down the steep West into a wondrous hue  Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent  Where the swift sun yet paus'd in his descent  Among the many-folded hills: they were  Those famous Euganean hills, which bear,  As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles,  The likeness of a clump of peakèd isles--  And then--as if the Earth and Sea had been  Dissolv'd into one lake of fire, were seen  Those mountains towering as from waves of flame  Around the vaporous sun, from which there came  The inmost purple spirit of light, and made  Their very peaks transparent. ""Ere it fade,""  Said my companion, ""I will show you soon  A better station""--so, o'er the lagune  We glided; and from that funereal bark  I lean'd, and saw the city, and could mark  How from their many isles, in evening's gleam,  Its temples and its palaces did seem  Like fabrics of enchantment pil'd to Heaven.  I was about to speak, when--""We are even  Now at the point I meant,"" said Maddalo,  And bade the gondolieri cease to row.  ""Look, Julian, on the west, and listen well  If you hear not a deep and heavy bell.""  I look'd, and saw between us and the sun  A building on an island; such a one  As age to age might add, for uses vile,  A windowless, deform'd and dreary pile;  And on the top an open tower, where hung  A bell, which in the radiance sway'd and swung;  We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue:  The broad sun sunk behind it, and it toll'd  In strong and black relief. ""What we behold  Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,""  Said Maddalo, ""and ever at this hour  Those who may cross the water, hear that bell  Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell,  To vespers."" ""As much skill as need to pray  In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they  To their stern Maker,"" I replied. ""O ho!  You talk as in years past,"" said Maddalo.  "" 'Tis strange men change not. You were ever still  Among Christ's flock a perilous infidel,  A wolf for the meek lambs--if you can't swim  Beware of Providence."" I look'd on him,  But the gay smile had faded in his eye.  ""And such,"" he cried, ""is our mortality,  And this must be the emblem and the sign  Of what should be eternal and divine!  And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,  Hung in a heaven-illumin'd tower, must toll  Our thoughts and our desires to meet below  Round the rent heart and pray--as madmen do  For what? they know not--till the night of death,  As sunset that strange vision, severeth  Our memory from itself, and us from all  We sought and yet were baffled."" I recall  The sense of what he said, although I mar  The force of his expressions. The broad star  Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,  And the black bell became invisible,  And the red tower look'd gray, and all between  The churches, ships and palaces were seen  Huddled in gloom;--into the purple sea  The orange hues of heaven sunk silently.  We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola  Convey'd me to my lodgings by the way.    The following morn was rainy, cold and dim:  Ere Maddalo arose, I call'd on him,  And whilst I waited with his child I play'd;  A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made,  A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,  Graceful without design and unforeseeing,  With eyes--Oh speak not of her eyes!--which seem  Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam  With such deep meaning, as we never see  But in the human countenance: with me  She was a special favourite: I had nurs'd  Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first  To this bleak world; and she yet seem'd to know  On second sight her ancient playfellow,  Less chang'd than she was by six months or so;  For after her first shyness was worn out  We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,  When the Count enter'd. Salutations past--  ""The word you spoke last night might well have cast  A darkness on my spirit--if man be  The passive thing you say, I should not see  Much harm in the religions and old saws  (Though I may never own such leaden laws)  Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:  Mine is another faith""--thus much I spoke  And noting he replied not, added: ""See  This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;  She spends a happy time with little care,  While we to such sick thoughts subjected are  As came on you last night. It is our will  That thus enchains us to permitted ill.  We might be otherwise. We might be all  We dream of happy, high, majestical.  Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek  But in our mind? and if we were not weak  Should we be less in deed than in desire?""  ""Ay, if we were not weak--and we aspire  How vainly to be strong!"" said Maddalo:  ""You talk Utopia."" ""It remains to know,""  I then rejoin'd, ""and those who try may find  How strong the chains are which our spirit bind;  Brittle perchance as straw.... We are assur'd  Much may be conquer'd, much may be endur'd,  Of what degrades and crushes us. We know  That we have power over ourselves to do  And suffer--what, we know not till we try;  But something nobler than to live and die:  So taught those kings of old philosophy  Who reign'd, before Religion made men blind;  And those who suffer with their suffering kind  Yet feel their faith, religion."" ""My dear friend,""  Said Maddalo, ""my judgement will not bend  To your opinion, though I think you might  Make such a system refutation-tight  As far as words go. I knew one like you  Who to this city came some months ago,  With whom I argu'd in this sort, and he  Is now gone mad--and so he answer'd me--  Poor fellow! but if you would like to go  We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show  How vain are such aspiring theories.""  ""I hope to prove the induction otherwise,  And that a want of that true theory, still,  Which seeks a 'soul of goodness' in things ill  Or in himself or others, has thus bow'd  His being. There are some by nature proud,  Who patient in all else demand but this--  To love and be belov'd with gentleness;  And being scorn'd, what wonder if they die  Some living death? this is not destiny  But man's own wilful ill.""      As thus I spoke  Servants announc'd the gondola, and we  Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea  Sail'd to the island where the madhouse stands.

Oh, guide me!And bid the deep hide me,For he grasps me now by the hair!'The loud Ocean heard, To its blue depth stirred,And divided at her prayer;And under the waterThe Earth’s white daughterFled like a sunny beam; Behind her descendedHer billows, unblendedWith the brackish Dorian stream:—Like a gloomy stainOn the emerald main Alpheus rushed behind,--As an eagle pursuingA dove to its ruinDown the streams of the cloudy wind.IV.Under the bowers Where the Ocean PowersSit on their pearled thrones;Through the coral woodsOf the weltering floods,Over heaps of unvalued stones;Through the dim beamsWhich amid the streamsWeave a network of coloured light;And under the caves,Where the shadowy wavesAre as green as the forest’s night:--Outspeeding the shark,And the sword-fish dark,Under the Ocean’s foam,And up through the riftsOf the mountain cliftsThey passed to their Dorian home.V.And now from their fountainsIn Enna’s mountains,Down one vale where the morning basks,Like friends once partedGrown single-hearted,They ply their watery tasks.At sunrise they leapFrom their cradles steepIn the cave of the shelving hill;At noontide they flowThrough the woods belowAnd the meadows of asphodel;And at night they sleepIn the rocking deepBeneath the Ortygian shore;--Like spirits that lieIn the azure skyWhen they love but live no more.

Seemed it that the chariot's wayLay through the midst of an immense concaveRadiant with million constellations, tingedWith shades of infinite color,And semicircled with a beltFlashing incessant meteors.The magic car moved on.As they approached their goal,The coursers seemed to gather speed;The sea no longer was distinguished; earth Appeared a vast and shadowy sphere;The sun's unclouded orbRolled through the black concave;Its rays of rapid lightParted around the chariot's swifter course,And fell, like ocean's feathery sprayDashed from the boiling surgeBefore a vessel's prow.The magic car moved on.Earth's distant orb appeared The smallest light that twinkles in the heaven;Whilst round the chariot's wayInnumerable systems rolledAnd countless spheres diffusedAn ever-varying glory.It was a sight of wonder: someWere hornÃ¨d like the crescent moon;Some shed a mild and silver beamLike Hesperus o'er the western sea;Some dashed athwart with trains of flame, Like worlds to death and ruin driven;Some shone like suns, and as the chariot passed,Eclipsed all other light.Spirit of Nature! here-In this interminable wildernessOf worlds, at whose immensityEven soaring fancy staggers,Here is thy fitting temple!Yet not the lightest leafThat quivers to the passing breeze Is less instinct with thee;Yet not the meanest wormThat lurks in graves and fattens on the dead,Less shares thy eternal breath!Spirit of Nature! thou,Imperishable as this scene--Here is thy fitting temple!

The Shore of the Lake of Como.HELENCome hither, my sweet Rosalind.'T is long since thou and I have met;And yet methinks it were unkindThose moments to forget.Come, sit by me. I see thee standBy this lone lake, in this far land,Thy loose hair in the light wind flying,Thy sweet voice to each tone of evenUnited, and thine eyes replyingTo the hues of yon fair heaven. Come, gentle friend! wilt sit by me?And be as thou wert wont to beEre we were disunited?None doth behold us now; the powerThat led us forth at this lone hourWill be but ill requitedIf thou depart in scorn. Oh, come,And talk of our abandoned home!Remember, this is Italy,And we are exiles. Talk with me Of that our land, whose wilds and floods,Barren and dark although they be,Were dearer than these chestnut woods;Those heathy paths, that inland stream,And the blue mountains, shapes which seemLike wrecks of childhood's sunny dream;Which that we have abandoned now,Weighs on the heart like that remorseWhich altered friendship leaves. I seekNo more our youthful intercourse. That cannot be! Rosalind, speak,Speak to me! Leave me not! When morn did come,When evening fell upon our common home,When for one hour we parted,--do not frown;I would not chide thee, though thy faith is broken;But turn to me. Oh! by this cherished tokenOf woven hair, which thou wilt not disown,Turn, as 't were but the memory of me,And not my scornèd self who prayed to thee!ROSALINDIs it a dream, or do I see And hear frail Helen? I would fleeThy tainting touch; but former yearsArise, and bring forbidden tears;And my o'erburdened memorySeeks yet its lost repose in thee.I share thy crime. I cannot chooseBut weep for thee; mine own strange griefBut seldom stoops to such relief;Nor ever did I love thee less,Though mourning o'er thy wickedness Even with a sister's woe. I knewWhat to the evil world is due,And therefore sternly did refuseTo link me with the infamyOf one so lost as Helen. Now,Bewildered by my dire despair,Wondering I blush, and weep that thouShouldst love me still--thou only!--There,Let us sit on that gray stoneTill our mournful talk be done. HELENAlas! not there; I cannot bearThe murmur of this lake to hear.A sound from there, Rosalind dear,Which never yet I heard elsewhereBut in our native land, recurs,Even here where now we meet. It stirsToo much of suffocating sorrow!In the dell of yon dark chestnut woodIs a stone seat, a solitudeLess like our own. The ghost of peace Will not desert this spot. To-morrow,If thy kind feelings should not cease,We may sit here.ROSALINDThou lead, my sweet,And I will follow.HENRY'T is Fenici's seatWhere you are going? This is not the way,Mamma; it leads behind those trees that growClose to the little river.HELENYes, I know;I was bewildered. Kiss me and be gay,Dear boy; why do you sob?HENRYI do not know;But it might break any one's heart to see You and the lady cry so bitterly.HELENIt is a gentle child, my friend. Go home,Henry, and play with Lilla till I come.We only cried with joy to see each other;We are quite merry now. Good night.The boyLifted a sudden look upon his mother,And, in the gleam of forced and hollow joyWhich lightened o'er her face, laughed with the gleeOf light and unsuspecting infancy,And whispered in her ear, 'Bring home with you That sweet strange lady-friend.' Then off he flew,But stopped, and beckoned with a meaning smile,Where the road turned. Pale Rosalind the while,Hiding her face, stood weeping silently.In silence then they took the wayBeneath the forest's solitude.It was a vast and antique wood,Through which they took their way;And the gray shades of eveningO'er that green wilderness did fling Still deeper solitude.Pursuing still the path that woundThe vast and knotted trees around,Through which slow shades were wandering,To a deep lawny dell they came,To a stone seat beside a spring,O'er which the columned wood did frameA roofless temple, like the faneWhere, ere new creeds could faith obtain,Man's early race once knelt beneath The overhanging deity.O'er this fair fountain hung the sky,Now spangled with rare stars. The snake,The pale snake, that with eager breathCreeps here his noontide thirst to slake,Is beaming with many a mingled hue,Shed from yon dome's eternal blue,When he floats on that dark and lucid floodIn the light of his own loveliness;And the birds, that in the fountain dip Their plumes, with fearless fellowshipAbove and round him wheel and hover.The fitful wind is heard to stirOne solitary leaf on high;The chirping of the grasshopperFills every pause. There is emotionIn all that dwells at noontide here;Then through the intricate wild woodA maze of life and light and motionIs woven. But there is stillness now-- Gloom, and the trance of Nature now.The snake is in his cave asleep;The birds are on the branches dreaming;Only the shadows creep;Only the glow-worm is gleaming;Only the owls and the nightingalesWake in this dell when daylight fails,And gray shades gather in the woods;And the owls have all fled far awayIn a merrier glen to hoot and play, For the moon is veiled and sleeping now.The accustomed nightingale still broodsOn her accustomed bough,But she is mute; for her false mateHas fled and left her desolate.This silent spot tradition oldHad peopled with the spectral dead.For the roots of the speaker's hair felt coldAnd stiff, as with tremulous lips he toldThat a hellish shape at midnight led The ghost of a youth with hoary hair,And sate on the seat beside him there,Till a naked child came wandering by,When the fiend would change to a lady fair!A fearful tale! the truth was worse;For here a sister and a brotherHad solemnized a monstrous curse,Meeting in this fair solitude;For beneath yon very sky,Had they resigned to one another Body and soul. The multitude,Tracking them to the secret wood,Tore limb from limb their innocent child,And stabbed and trampled on its mother;But the youth, for God's most holy grace,A priest saved to burn in the market-place.Duly at evening Helen cameTo this lone silent spot,From the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrowSo much of sympathy to borrow As soothed her own dark lot.Duly each evening from her home,With her fair child would Helen comeTo sit upon that antique seat,While the hues of day were pale;And the bright boy beside her feetNow lay, lifting at intervalsHis broad blue eyes on her;Now, where some sudden impulse calls,Following. He was a gentle boy And in all gentle sorts took joy.Oft in a dry leaf for a boat,With a small feather for a sail,His fancy on that spring would float,If some invisible breeze might stirIts marble calm; and Helen smiledThrough tears of awe on the gay child,To think that a boy as fair as he,In years which never more may be,By that same fount, in that same wood, The like sweet fancies had pursued;And that a mother, lost like her,Had mournfully sate watching him.Then all the scene was wont to swimThrough the mist of a burning tear.For many months had Helen knownThis scene; and now she thither turnedHer footsteps, not alone.The friend whose falsehood she had mournedSate with her on that seat of stone. Silent they sate; for evening,And the power its glimpses bring,Had with one awful shadow quelledThe passion of their grief. They sateWith linkèd hands, for unrepelledHad Helen taken Rosalind's.Like the autumn wind, when it unbindsThe tangled locks of the nightshade's hairWhich is twined in the sultry summer airRound the walls of an outworn sepulchre, Did the voice of Helen, sad and sweet,And the sound of her heart that ever beatAs with sighs and words she breathed on her,Unbind the knots of her friend's despair,Till her thoughts were free to float and flow;And from her laboring bosom now,Like the bursting of a prisoned flame,The voice of a long-pent sorrow came.ROSALINDI saw the dark earth fall uponThe coffin; and I saw the stone Laid over him whom this cold breastHad pillowed to his nightly rest!Thou knowest not, thou canst not knowMy agony. Oh! I could not weep.The sources whence such blessings flowWere not to be approached by me!But I could smile, and I could sleep,Though with a self-accusing heart.In morning's light, in evening's gloom,I watched--and would not thence depart-- My husband's unlamented tomb.My children knew their sire was gone;But when I told them, 'He is dead,'They laughed aloud in frantic glee,They clapped their hands and leaped about,Answering each other's ecstasyWith many a prank and merry shout.But I sate silent and alone,Wrapped in the mock of mourning weed.They laughed, for he was dead; but I Sate with a hard and tearless eye,And with a heart which would denyThe secret joy it could not quell,Low muttering o'er his loathèd name;Till from that self-contention cameRemorse where sin was none; a hellWhich in pure spirits should not dwell.I 'll tell thee truth. He was a manHard, selfish, loving only gold,Yet full of guile; his pale eyes ran With tears which each some falsehood told,And oft his smooth and bridled tongueWould give the lie to his flushing cheek;He was a coward to the strong;He was a tyrant to the weak,On whom his vengeance he would wreak;For scorn, whose arrows search the heart,From many a stranger's eye would dart,And on his memory cling, and followHis soul to its home so cold and hollow. He was a tyrant to the weak,And we were such, alas the day!Oft, when my little ones at playWere in youth's natural lightness gay,Or if they listened to some taleOf travellers, or of fairyland,When the light from the wood-fire's dying brandFlashed on their faces,--if they heardOr thought they heard upon the stairHis footstep, the suspended word Died on my lips; we all grew pale;The babe at my bosom was hushed with fearIf it thought it heard its father near;And my two wild boys would near my kneeCling, cowed and cowering fearfully.I 'll tell thee truth: I loved another.His name in my ear was ever ringing,His form to my brain was ever clinging;Yet, if some stranger breathed that name,My lips turned white, and my heart beat fast. My nights were once haunted by dreams of flame,My days were dim in the shadow castBy the memory of the same!Day and night, day and night,He was my breath and life and light,For three short years, which soon were passed.On the fourth, my gentle motherLed me to the shrine, to beHis sworn bride eternally.And now we stood on the altar stair, When my father came from a distant land,And with a loud and fearful cryRushed between us suddenly.I saw the stream of his thin gray hair,I saw his lean and lifted hand,And heard his words--and live! O God!Wherefore do I live?--'Hold, hold!'He cried, 'I tell thee 't is her brother!Thy mother, boy, beneath the sodOf yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold; I am now weak, and pale, and old;We were once dear to one another,I and that corpse! Thou art our child!'Then with a laugh both long and wildThe youth upon the pavement fell.They found him dead! All looked on me,The spasms of my despair to see;But I was calm. I went away;I was clammy-cold like clay.I did not weep; I did not speak; But day by day, week after week,I walked about like a corpse alive.Alas! sweet friend, you must believeThis heart is stone--it did not break.My father lived a little while,But all might see that he was dying,He smiled with such a woful smile.When he was in the churchyard lyingAmong the worms, we grew quite poor,So that no one would give us bread; My mother looked at me, and saidFaint words of cheer, which only meantThat she could die and be content;So I went forth from the same church doorTo another husband's bed.And this was he who died at last,When weeks and months and years had passed,Through which I firmly did fulfilMy duties, a devoted wife,With the stern step of vanquished will Walking beneath the night of life,Whose hours extinguished, like slow rainFalling forever, pain by pain,The very hope of death's dear rest;Which, since the heart within my breastOf natural life was dispossessed,Its strange sustainer there had been.When flowers were dead, and grass was greenUpon my mother's grave--that motherWhom to outlive, and cheer, and make My wan eyes glitter for her sake,Was my vowed task, the single careWhich once gave life to my despair--When she was a thing that did not stir,And the crawling worms were cradling herTo a sleep more deep and so more sweetThan a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee,I lived; a living pulse then beatBeneath my heart that awakened me.What was this pulse so warm and free? Alas! I knew it could not beMy own dull blood. 'T was like a thoughtOf liquid love, that spread and wroughtUnder my bosom and in my brain,And crept with the blood through every vein,And hour by hour, day after day,The wonder could not charm awayBut laid in sleep my wakeful pain,Until I knew it was a child,And then I wept. For long, long years These frozen eyes had shed no tears;But now--'t was the season fair and mildWhen April has wept itself to May;I sate through the sweet sunny dayBy my window bowered round with leaves,And down my cheeks the quick tears ranLike twinkling rain-drops from the eaves,When warm spring showers are passing o'er.O Helen, none can ever tellThe joy it was to weep once more! I wept to think how hard it wereTo kill my babe, and take from itThe sense of light, and the warm air,And my own fond and tender care,And love and smiles; ere I knew yetThat these for it might, as for me,Be the masks of a grinning mockery.And haply, I would dream, 't were sweetTo feed it from my faded breast,Or mark my own heart's restless beat And watch the growing soul beneathDawn in faint smiles; and hear its breath,Half interrupted by calm sighs,And search the depth of its fair eyesFor long departed memories!And so I lived till that sweet loadWas lightened. Darkly forward flowedThe stream of years, and on it boreTwo shapes of gladness to my sight; Two other babes, delightful more,In my lost soul's abandoned night,Than their own country ships may beSailing towards wrecked marinersWho cling to the rock of a wintry sea.For each, as it came, brought soothing tears;And a loosening warmth, as each one laySucking the sullen milk away,About my frozen heart did play,And weaned it, oh, how painfully-- As they themselves were weaned each oneFrom that sweet food--even from the thirstOf death, and nothingness, and rest,Strange inmate of a living breast,Which all that I had undergoneOf grief and shame, since she who firstThe gates of that dark refuge closedCame to my sight, and almost burstThe seal of that Lethean spring--But these fair shadows interposed. For all delights are shadows now!And from my brain to my dull browThe heavy tears gather and flow.I cannot speak--oh, let me weep!The tears which fell from her wan eyesGlimmered among the moonlight dew.Her deep hard sobs and heavy sighsTheir echoes in the darkness threw.When she grew calm, she thus did keepThe tenor of her tale:--He died; I know not how; he was not old,If age be numbered by its years;But he was bowed and bent with fears,Pale with the quenchless thirst of gold,Which, like fierce fever, left him weak;And his strait lip and bloated cheekWere warped in spasms by hollow sneers;And selfish cares with barren plough,Not age, had lined his narrow brow,And foul and cruel thoughts, which feed Upon the withering life within,Like vipers on some poisonous weed.Whether his ill were death or sinNone knew, until he died indeed,And then men owned they were the same.Seven days within my chamber layThat corse, and my babes made holiday.At last, I told them what is death.The eldest, with a kind of shame,Came to my knees with silent breath, And sate awe-stricken at my feet;And soon the others left their play,And sate there too. It is unmeetTo shed on the brief flower of youthThe withering knowledge of the grave.From me remorse then wrung that truth.I could not bear the joy which gaveToo just a response to mine own.In vain. I dared not feign a groan;And in their artless looks I saw, Between the mists of fear and awe,That my own thought was theirs; and theyExpressed it not in words, but said,Each in its heart, how every dayWill pass in happy work and play,Now he is dead and gone away!After the funeral all our kinAssembled, and the will was read.My friend, I tell thee, even the deadHave strength, their putrid shrouds within, To blast and torture. Those who liveStill fear the living, but a corseIs merciless, and Power doth giveTo such pale tyrants half the spoilHe rends from those who groan and toil,Because they blush not with remorseAmong their crawling worms. Behold,I have no child! my tale grows oldWith grief, and staggers; let it reachThe limits of my feeble speech, And languidly at length reclineOn the brink of its own grave and mine.Thou knowest what a thing is PovertyAmong the fallen on evil days.'T is Crime, and Fear, and Infamy,And houseless Want in frozen waysWandering ungarmented, and Pain,And, worse than all, that inward stain,Foul Self-contempt, which drowns in sneersYouth's starlight smile, and makes its tears First like hot gall, then dry forever!And well thou knowest a mother neverCould doom her children to this ill,And well he knew the same. The willImported that, if e'er againI sought my children to behold,Or in my birthplace did remainBeyond three days, whose hours were told,They should inherit nought; and he,To whom next came their patrimony, A sallow lawyer, cruel and cold,Aye watched me, as the will was read,With eyes askance, which sought to seeThe secrets of my agony;And with close lips and anxious browStood canvassing still to and froThe chance of my resolve, and allThe dead man's caution just did call;For in that killing lie 't was said--'She is adulterous, and doth hold In secret that the Christian creedIs false, and therefore is much needThat I should have a care to saveMy children from eternal fire.'Friend, he was sheltered by the grave,And therefore dared to be a liar!In truth, the Indian on the pyreOf her dead husband, half consumed,As well might there be false as ITo those abhorred embraces doomed, Far worse than fire's brief agony.As to the Christian creed, if trueOr false, I never questioned it;I took it as the vulgar do;Nor my vexed soul had leisure yetTo doubt the things men say, or deemThat they are other than they seem.All present who those crimes did hear,In feigned or actual scorn and fear,Men, women, children, slunk away, Whispering with self-contented prideWhich half suspects its own base lie.I spoke to none, nor did abide,But silently I went my way,Nor noticed I where joyouslySate my two younger babes at playIn the courtyard through which I passed;But went with footsteps firm and fastTill I came to the brink of the ocean green,And there, a woman with gray hairs, Who had my mother's servant been,Kneeling, with many tears and prayers,Made me accept a purse of gold,Half of the earnings she had keptTo refuge her when weak and old.With woe, which never sleeps or slept,I wander now. 'T is a vain thought--But on yon Alp, whose snowy head'Mid the azure air is islanded,(We see it--o'er the flood of cloud, Which sunrise from its eastern cavesDrives, wrinkling into golden waves,Hung with its precipices proud--From that gray stone where first we met)There--now who knows the dead feel nought?--Should be my grave; for he who yetIs my soul's soul once said: ''T were sweet'Mid stars and lightnings to abide,And winds, and lulling snows that beatWith their soft flakes the mountain wide, Where weary meteor lamps repose,And languid storms their pinions close,And all things strong and bright and pure,And ever during, aye endure.Who knows, if one were buried there,But these things might our spirits make,Amid the all-surrounding air,Their own eternity partake?'Then 't was a wild and playful sayingAt which I laughed or seemed to laugh. They were his words--now heed my praying,And let them be my epitaph.Thy memory for a term may beMy monument. Wilt remember me?I know thou wilt; and canst forgive,Whilst in this erring world to liveMy soul disdained not, that I thoughtIts lying forms were worthy aught,And much less thee.HELENOh, speak not so!But come to me and pour thy woe Into this heart, full though it be,Aye overflowing with its own.I thought that grief had severed meFrom all beside who weep and groan,Its likeness upon earth to be--Its express image; but thou artMore wretched. Sweet, we will not partHenceforth, if death be not division;If so, the dead feel no contrition.But wilt thou hear, since last we parted, All that has left me broken-hearted?ROSALINDYes, speak. The faintest stars are scarcely shornOf their thin beams by that delusive mornWhich sinks again in darkness, like the lightOf early love, soon lost in total night.HELENAlas! Italian winds are mild,But my bosom is cold--wintry cold;When the warm air weaves, among the fresh leaves,Soft music, my poor brain is wild,And I am weak like a nursling child, Though my soul with grief is gray and old.ROSALINDWeep not at thine own words, though they must makeMe weep. What is thy tale?HELENI fear 't will shakeThy gentle heart with tears. Thou wellRememberest when we met no more;And, though I dwelt with Lionel,That friendless caution pierced me soreWith grief; a wound my spirit boreIndignantly--but when he died,With him lay dead both hope and pride. Alas! all hope is buried now.But then men dreamed the aged earthWas laboring in that mighty birthWhich many a poet and a sageHas aye foreseen--the happy ageWhen truth and love shall dwell belowAmong the works and ways of men;Which on this world not power but willEven now is wanting to fulfil.Among mankind what thence befell Of strife, how vain, is known too well;When Liberty's dear pæan fell'Mid murderous howls. To Lionel,Though of great wealth and lineage high,Yet through those dungeon walls there cameThy thrilling light, O Liberty!And as the meteor's midnight flameStartles the dreamer, sun-like truthFlashed on his visionary youth,And filled him, not with love, but faith, And hope, and courage mute in death;For love and life in him were twins,Born at one birth. In every otherFirst life, then love, its course begins,Though they be children of one mother;And so through this dark world they fleetDivided, till in death they meet;But he loved all things ever. ThenHe passed amid the strife of men,And stood at the throne of armèd power Pleading for a world of woe.Secure as one on a rock-built towerO'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro,'Mid the passions wild of humankindHe stood, like a spirit calming them;For, it was said, his words could bindLike music the lulled crowd, and stemThat torrent of unquiet dreamWhich mortals truth and reason deem,But is revenge and fear and pride. Joyous he was; and hope and peaceOn all who heard him did abide,Raining like dew from his sweet talk,As where the evening star may walkAlong the brink of the gloomy seas,Liquid mists of splendor quiver.His very gestures touched to tearsThe unpersuaded tyrant, neverSo moved before; his presence stungThe torturers with their victim's pain, And none knew how; and through their earsThe subtle witchcraft of his tongueUnlocked the hearts of those who keepGold, the world's bond of slavery.Men wondered, and some sneered to seeOne sow what he could never reap;For he is rich, they said, and young,And might drink from the depths of luxury.If he seeks fame, fame never crownedThe champion of a trampled creed; If he seeks power, power is enthroned'Mid ancient rights and wrongs, to feedWhich hungry wolves with praise and spoilThose who would sit near power must toil;And such, there sitting, all may see.What seeks he? All that others seekHe casts away, like a vile weedWhich the sea casts unreturningly.That poor and hungry men should breakThe laws which wreak them toil and scorn We understand; but Lionel,We know, is rich and nobly born.So wondered they; yet all men lovedYoung Lionel, though few approved;All but the priests, whose hatred fellLike the unseen blight of a smiling day,The withering honey-dew which clingsUnder the bright green buds of MayWhilst they unfold their emerald wings;For he made verses wild and queer On the strange creeds priests hold so dearBecause they bring them land and gold.Of devils and saints and all such gearHe made tales which whoso heard or readWould laugh till he were almost dead.So this grew a proverb: 'Don't get oldTill Lionel's Banquet in Hell you hear,And then you will laugh yourself young again.'So the priests hated him, and heRepaid their hate with cheerful glee. Ah, smiles and joyance quickly died,For public hope grew pale and dimIn an altered time and tide,And in its wasting withered him,As a summer flower that blows too soonDroops in the smile of the waning moon,When it scatters through an April nightThe frozen dews of wrinkling blight.None now hoped more. Gray Power was seatedSafely on her ancestral throne; And Faith, the Python, undefeatedEven to its blood-stained steps dragged onHer foul and wounded train; and menWere trampled and deceived again,And words and shows again could bindThe wailing tribes of humankindIn scorn and famine. Fire and bloodRaged round the raging multitude,To fields remote by tyrants sentTo be the scornèd instrument With which they drag from mines of goreThe chains their slaves yet ever wore;And in the streets men met each other,And by old altars and in halls,And smiled again at festivals.But each man found in his heart's brotherCold cheer; for all, though half deceived,The outworn creeds again believed,And the same round anew beganWhich the weary world yet ever ran. Many then wept, not tears, but gall,Within their hearts, like drops which fallWasting the fountain-stone away.And in that dark and evil dayDid all desires and thoughts that claimMen's care--ambition, friendship, fame,Love, hope, though hope was now despair--Indue the colors of this change,As from the all-surrounding airThe earth takes hues obscure and strange, When storm and earthquake linger there.And so, my friend, it then befellTo many,--most to Lionel,Whose hope was like the life of youthWithin him, and when dead becameA spirit of unresting flame,Which goaded him in his distressOver the world's vast wilderness.Three years he left his native land,And on the fourth, when he returned, None knew him; he was stricken deepWith some disease of mind, and turnedInto aught unlike Lionel.On him--on whom, did he pause in sleep,Serenest smiles were wont to keep,And, did he wake, a wingèd bandOf bright Persuasions, which had fedOn his sweet lips and liquid eyes,Kept their swift pinions half outspreadTo do on men his least command-- On him, whom once 't was paradiseEven to behold, now misery lay.In his own heart 't was merciless--To all things else none may expressIts innocence and tenderness.'T was said that he had refuge soughtIn love from his unquiet thoughtIn distant lands, and been deceivedBy some strange show; for there were found,Blotted with tears--as those relieved By their own words are wont to do--These mournful verses on the ground,By all who read them blotted too.'How am I changed! my hopes were once like fire;I loved, and I believed that life was love.How am I lost! on wings of swift desireAmong Heaven's winds my spirit once did move.I slept, and silver dreams did aye inspireMy liquid sleep; I woke, and did approveAll Nature to my heart, and thought to make A paradise of earth for one sweet sake.'I love, but I believe in love no more.I feel desire, but hope not. Oh, from sleepMost vainly must my weary brain imploreIts long lost flattery now! I wake to weep,And sit through the long day gnawing the coreOf my bitter heart, and, like a miser, keep--Since none in what I feel take pain or pleasure--To my own soul its self-consuming treasure.'He dwelt beside me near the sea; And oft in evening did we meet,When the waves, beneath the starlight, fleeO'er the yellow sands with silver feet,And talked. Our talk was sad and sweet,Till slowly from his mien there passedThe desolation which it spoke;And smiles--as when the lightning's blastHas parched some heaven-delighting oak,The next spring shows leaves pale and rare,But like flowers delicate and fair, On its rent boughs--again arrayedHis countenance in tender light;His words grew subtle fire, which madeThe air his hearers breathed delight;His motions, like the winds, were free,Which bend the bright grass gracefully,Then fade away in circlets faint;And wingèd Hope--on which upborneHis soul seemed hovering in his eyes,Like some bright spirit newly born Floating amid the sunny skies--Sprang forth from his rent heart anew.Yet o'er his talk, and looks, and mien,Tempering their loveliness too keen,Past woe its shadow backward threw;Till, like an exhalation spreadFrom flowers half drunk with evening dew,They did become infectious--sweetAnd subtle mists of sense and thought,Which wrapped us soon, when we might meet, Almost from our own looks and aughtThe wild world holds. And so his mindWas healed, while mine grew sick with fear;For ever now his health declined,Like some frail bark which cannot bearThe impulse of an altered wind,Though prosperous; and my heart grew full,'Mid its new joy, of a new care;For his cheek became, not pale, but fair,As rose-o'ershadowed lilies are; And soon his deep and sunny hair,In this alone less beautiful,Like grass in tombs grew wild and rare.The blood in his translucent veinsBeat, not like animal life, but loveSeemed now its sullen springs to move,When life had failed, and all its pains;And sudden sleep would seize him oftLike death, so calm,--but that a tear,His pointed eye-lashes between, Would gather in the light sereneOf smiles whose lustre bright and softBeneath lay undulating there.His breath was like inconstant flameAs eagerly it went and came;And I hung o'er him in his sleep,Till, like an image in the lakeWhich rains disturb, my tears would breakThe shadow of that slumber deep.Then he would bid me not to weep, And say, with flattery false yet sweet,That death and he could never meet,If I would never part with him.And so we loved, and did uniteAll that in us was yet divided;For when he said, that many a rite,By men to bind but once provided,Could not be shared by him and me,Or they would kill him in their glee,I shuddered, and then laughing said-- 'We will have rites our faith to bind,But our church shall be the starry night,Our altar the grassy earth outspread,And our priest the muttering wind.''T was sunset as I spoke. One starHad scarce burst forth, when from afarThe ministers of misrule sentSeized upon Lionel, and boreHis chained limbs to a dreary tower,In the midst of a city vast and wide. For he, they said, from his mind had bentAgainst their gods keen blasphemy,For which, though his soul must roasted beIn hell's red lakes immortally,Yet even on earth must he abideThe vengeance of their slaves: a trial,I think, men call it. What availAre prayers and tears, which chase denialFrom the fierce savage nursed in hate?What the knit soul that pleading and pale Makes wan the quivering cheek which lateIt painted with its own delight?We were divided. As I could,I stilled the tingling of my blood,And followed him in their despite,As a widow follows, pale and wild,The murderers and corse of her only child;And when we came to the prison door,And I prayed to share his dungeon floorWith prayers which rarely have been spurned, And when men drove me forth, and IStared with blank frenzy on the sky,--A farewell look of love he turned,Half calming me; then gazed awhile,As if through that black and massy pile,And through the crowd around him there,And through the dense and murky air,And the thronged streets, he did espyWhat poets know and prophesy;And said, with voice that made them shiver And clung like music in my brain,And which the mute walls spoke againProlonging it with deepened strain--'Fear not the tyrants shall rule forever,Or the priests of the bloody faith;They stand on the brink of that mighty river,Whose waves they have tainted with death;It is fed from the depths of a thousand dells,Around them it foams, and rages, and swells,And their swords and their sceptres I floating see, Like wrecks, in the surge of eternity.'I dwelt beside the prison gate;And the strange crowd that out and inPassed, some, no doubt, with mine own fate,Might have fretted me with its ceaseless din,But the fever of care was louder within.Soon but too late, in penitenceOr fear, his foes released him thence.I saw his thin and languid form,As leaning on the jailor's arm, Whose hardened eyes grew moist the whileTo meet his mute and faded smileAnd hear his words of kind farewell,He tottered forth from his damp cell.Many had never wept before,From whom fast tears then gushed and fell;Many will relent no more,Who sobbed like infants then; ay, allWho thronged the prison's stony hall,The rulers or the slaves of law, Felt with a new surprise and aweThat they were human, till strong shameMade them again become the same.The prison bloodhounds, huge and grim,From human looks the infection caught,And fondly crouched and fawned on him;And men have heard the prisoners say,Who in their rotting dungeons lay,That from that hour, throughout one day,The fierce despair and hate which kept Their trampled bosoms almost slept,Where, like twin vultures, they hung feedingOn each heart's wound, wide torn and bleeding,--Because their jailors' rule, they thought,Grew merciful, like a parent's sway.I know not how, but we were free;And Lionel sate alone with me,As the carriage drove through the streets apace;And we looked upon each other's face;And the blood in our fingers intertwined Ran like the thoughts of a single mind,As the swift emotions went and cameThrough the veins of each united frame.So through the long, long streets we passedOf the million-peopled City vast;Which is that desert, where each oneSeeks his mate yet is alone,Beloved and sought and mourned of none;Until the clear blue sky was seen,And the grassy meadows bright and green. And then I sunk in his embraceEnclosing there a mighty spaceOf love; and so we travelled onBy woods, and fields of yellow flowers,And towns, and villages, and towers,Day after day of happy hours.It was the azure time of June,When the skies are deep in the stainless noon,And the warm and fitful breezes shakeThe fresh green leaves of the hedge-row briar; And there were odors then to makeThe very breath we did respireA liquid element, whereonOur spirits, like delighted thingsThat walk the air on subtle wings,Floated and mingled far away'Mid the warm winds of the sunny day.And when the evening star came forthAbove the curve of the new bent moon,And light and sound ebbed from the earth, Like the tide of the full and the weary seaTo the depths of its own tranquillity,Our natures to its own reposeDid the earth's breathless sleep attune;Like flowers, which on each other closeTheir languid leaves when daylight's gone,We lay, till new emotions came,Which seemed to make each mortal frameOne soul of interwoven flame,A life in life, a second birth In worlds diviner far than earth;--Which, like two strains of harmonyThat mingle in the silent sky,Then slowly disunite, passed byAnd left the tenderness of tears,A soft oblivion of all fears,A sweet sleep:--so we travelled onTill we came to the home of Lionel,Among the mountains wild and lone,Beside the hoary western sea, Which near the verge of the echoing shoreThe massy forest shadowed o'er.The ancient steward with hair all hoar,As we alighted, wept to seeHis master changed so fearfully;And the old man's sobs did waken meFrom my dream of unremaining gladness;The truth flashed o'er me like quick madnessWhen I looked, and saw that there was deathOn Lionel. Yet day by day He lived, till fear grew hope and faith,And in my soul I dared to say,Nothing so bright can pass away;Death is dark, and foul, and dull,But he is--oh, how beautiful!Yet day by day he grew more weak,And his sweet voice, when he might speak,Which ne'er was loud, became more low;And the light which flashed through his waxen cheekGrew faint, as the rose-like hues which flow From sunset o'er the Alpine snow;And death seemed not like death in him,For the spirit of life o'er every limbLingered, a mist of sense and thought.When the summer wind faint odors broughtFrom mountain flowers, even as it passed,His cheek would change, as the noonday seaWhich the dying breeze sweeps fitfully.If but a cloud the sky o'ercast,You might see his color come and go, And the softest strain of music madeSweet smiles, yet sad, arise and fadeAmid the dew of his tender eyes;And the breath, with intermitting flow,Made his pale lips quiver and part.You might hear the beatings of his heart,Quick but not strong; and with my tressesWhen oft he playfully would bindIn the bowers of mossy lonelinessesHis neck, and win me so to mingle In the sweet depth of woven caresses,And our faint limbs were intertwined,--Alas! the unquiet life did tingleFrom mine own heart through every vein,Like a captive in dreams of liberty,Who beats the walls of his stony cell.But his, it seemed already free,Like the shadow of fire surrounding me!On my faint eyes and limbs did dwellThat spirit as it passed, till soon-- As a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon,Beneath its light invisible,Is seen when it folds its gray wings againTo alight on midnight's dusky plain--I lived and saw, and the gathering soulPassed from beneath that strong control,And I fell on a life which was sick with fearOf all the woe that now I bear.Amid a bloomless myrtle wood,On a green and sea-girt promontory Not far from where we dwelt, there stood,In record of a sweet sad story,An altar and a temple brightCircled by steps, and o'er the gateWas sculptured, 'To Fidelity;'And in the shrine an image sateAll veiled; but there was seen the lightOf smiles which faintly could expressA mingled pain and tendernessThrough that ethereal drapery. The left hand held the head, the right--Beyond the veil, beneath the skin,You might see the nerves quivering within--Was forcing the point of a barbèd dartInto its side-convulsing heart.An unskilled hand, yet one informedWith genius, had the marble warmedWith that pathetic life. This taleIt told: A dog had from the sea,When the tide was raging fearfully, Dragged Lionel's mother, weak and pale,Then died beside her on the sand,And she that temple thence had planned;But it was Lionel's own handHad wrought the image. Each new moonThat lady did, in this lone fane,The rites of a religion sweetWhose god was in her heart and brain.The seasons' loveliest flowers were strewnOn the marble floor beneath her feet, And she brought crowns of sea-buds whiteWhose odor is so sweet and faint,And weeds, like branching chrysolite,Woven in devices fine and quaint;And tears from her brown eyes did stainThe altar; need but look uponThat dying statue, fair and wan,If tears should cease, to weep again;And rare Arabian odors came,Through the myrtle copses, steaming thence From the hissing frankincense,Whose smoke, wool-white as ocean foam,Hung in dense flocks beneath the dome--That ivory dome, whose azure nightWith golden stars, like heaven, was brightO'er the split cedar's pointed flame;And the lady's harp would kindle thereThe melody of an old air,Softer than sleep; the villagersMixed their religion up with hers, And, as they listened round, shed tears.One eve he led me to this fane.Daylight on its last purple cloudWas lingering gray, and soon her strainThe nightingale began; now loud,Climbing in circles the windless sky,Now dying music; suddenly'T is scattered in a thousand notes;And now to the hushed ear it floatsLike field-smells known in infancy, Then, failing, soothes the air again.We sate within that temple lone,Pavilioned round with Parian stone;His mother's harp stood near, and oftI had awakened music softAmid its wires; the nightingaleWas pausing in her heaven-taught tale.'Now drain the cup,' said Lionel,'Which the poet-bird has crowned so wellWith the wine of her bright and liquid song! Heard'st thou not sweet words amongThat heaven-resounding minstrelsy?Heard'st thou not that those who dieAwake in a world of ecstasy?That love, when limbs are interwoven,And sleep, when the night of life is cloven,And thought, to the world's dim boundaries clinging,And music, when one beloved is singing,Is death? Let us drain right joyouslyThe cup which the sweet bird fills for me.' He paused, and to my lips he bentHis own; like spirit his words wentThrough all my limbs with the speed of fire;And his keen eyes, glittering through mine,Filled me with the flame divineWhich in their orbs was burning far,Like the light of an unmeasured starIn the sky of midnight dark and deep;Yes, 't was his soul that did inspireSounds which my skill could ne'er awaken; And first, I felt my fingers sweepThe harp, and a long quivering cryBurst from my lips in symphony;The dusk and solid air was shaken,As swift and swifter the notes cameFrom my touch, that wandered like quick flame,And from my bosom, laboringWith some unutterable thing.The awful sound of my own voice madeMy faint lips tremble; in some mood Of wordless thought Lionel stoodSo pale, that even beside his cheekThe snowy column from its shadeCaught whiteness; yet his countenance,Raised upward, burned with radianceOf spirit-piercing joy whose light,Like the moon struggling through the nightOf whirlwind-rifted clouds, did breakWith beams that might not be confined.I paused, but soon his gestures kindled New power, as by the moving windThe waves are lifted; and my songTo low soft notes now changed and dwindled,And, from the twinkling wires among,My languid fingers drew and flungCircles of life-dissolving sound,Yet faint; in aëry rings they boundMy Lionel, who, as every strainGrew fainter but more sweet, his mienSunk with the sound relaxedly; And slowly now he turned to me,As slowly faded from his faceThat awful joy; with look sereneHe was soon drawn to my embrace,And my wild song then died awayIn murmurs; words I dare not sayWe mixed, and on his lips mine fedTill they methought felt still and cold.'What is it with thee, love?' I said;No word, no look, no motion! yes, There was a change, but spare to guess,Nor let that moment's hope be told.I looked,--and knew that he was dead;And fell, as the eagle on the plainFalls when life deserts her brain,And the mortal lightning is veiled again.Oh, that I were now dead! but such--Did they not, love, demand too much,Those dying murmurs?--he forbade.Oh, that I once again were mad! And yet, dear Rosalind, not so,For I would live to share thy woe.Sweet boy! did I forget thee too?Alas, we know not what we doWhen we speak words.No memory moreIs in my mind of that sea-shore.Madness came on me, and a troopOf misty shapes did seem to sitBeside me, on a vessel's poop,And the clear north wind was driving it. Then I heard strange tongues, and saw strange flowers,And the stars methought grew unlike ours,And the azure sky and the stormless seaMade me believe that I had diedAnd waked in a world which was to meDrear hell, though heaven to all beside.Then a dead sleep fell on my mind,Whilst animal life many long yearsHad rescued from a chasm of tears;And, when I woke, I wept to find That the same lady, bright and wise,With silver locks and quick brown eyes,The mother of my Lionel,Had tended me in my distress,And died some months before. Nor lessWonder, but far more peace and joy,Brought in that hour my lovely boy.For through that trance my soul had wellThe impress of thy being kept;And if I waked or if I slept, No doubt, though memory faithless be,Thy image ever dwelt on me;And thus, O Lionel, like theeIs our sweet child. 'T is sure most strangeI knew not of so great a changeAs that which gave him birth, who nowIs all the solace of my woe.That Lionel great wealth had leftBy will to me, and that of allThe ready lies of law bereft My child and me,--might well befall.But let me think not of the scornWhich from the meanest I have borne,When, for my child's belovèd sake,I mixed with slaves, to vindicateThe very laws themselves do make;Let me not say scorn is my fate,Lest I be proud, suffering the sameWith those who live in deathless fame.She ceased.--'Lo, where red morning through the woods Is burning o'er the dew!' said Rosalind.And with these words they rose, and towards the floodOf the blue lake, beneath the leaves, now windWith equal steps and fingers intertwined.Thence to a lonely dwelling, where the shoreIs shadowed with steep rocks, and cypressesCleave with their dark green cones the silent skiesAnd with their shadows the clear depths below,And where a little terrace from its bowersOf blooming myrtle and faint lemon flowers Scatters its sense-dissolving fragrance o'erThe liquid marble of the windless lake;And where the aged forest's limbs look hoarUnder the leaves which their green garments make,They come. 'T is Helen's home, and clean and white,Like one which tyrants spare on our own landIn some such solitude; its casements brightShone through their vine-leaves in the morning sun,And even within 't was scarce like Italy.And when she saw how all things there were planned As in an English home, dim memoryDisturbed poor Rosalind; she stood as oneWhose mind is where his body cannot be,Till Helen led her where her child yet slept,And said, 'Observe, that brow was Lionel's,Those lips were his, and so he ever keptOne arm in sleep, pillowing his head with it.You cannot see his eyes--they are two wellsOf liquid love. Let us not wake him yet.'But Rosalind could bear no more, and wept A shower of burning tears which fell uponHis face, and so his opening lashes shoneWith tears unlike his own, as he did leapIn sudden wonder from his innocent sleep.So Rosalind and Helen lived togetherThenceforth--changed in all else, yet friends again,Such as they were, when o'er the mountain heatherThey wandered in their youth through sun and rain.And after many years, for human thingsChange even like the ocean and the wind, Her daughter was restored to Rosalind,And in their circle thence some visitingsOf joy 'mid their new calm would intervene.A lovely child she was, of looks serene,And motions which o'er things indifferent shedThe grace and gentleness from whence they came.And Helen's boy grew with her, and they fedFrom the same flowers of thought, until each mindLike springs which mingle in one flood became;And in their union soon their parents saw The shadow of the peace denied to them.And Rosalind--for when the living stemIs cankered in its heart, the tree must fall--Died ere her time; and with deep grief and aweThe pale survivors followed her remainsBeyond the region of dissolving rains,Up the cold mountain she was wont to callHer tomb; and on Chiavenna's precipiceThey raised a pyramid of lasting ice,Whose polished sides, ere day had yet begun, Caught the first glow of the unrisen sun,The last, when it had sunk; and through the nightThe charioteers of Arctos wheelèd roundIts glittering point, as seen from Helen's home,Whose sad inhabitants each year would come,With willing steps climbing that rugged height,And hang long locks of hair, and garlands boundWith amaranth flowers, which, in the clime's despite,Filled the frore air with unaccustomed light;Such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom Of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb.Helen, whose spirit was of softer mould,Whose sufferings too were less, death slowlier ledInto the peace of his dominion cold.She died among her kindred, being old.And know, that if love die not in the deadAs in the living, none of mortal kindAre blessed as now Helen and Rosalind.

I can give not what men call love:    But wilt thou accept not The worship the heart lifts above    And the heavens reject not, The desire of the moth for the star,    Of the night for the morrow, The devotion to something afar    From the sphere of our sorrow?

Queen Mab: Part Vi (Excerpts),"                             ""Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light,    Of which yon earth is one, is wide diffus'd   A Spirit of activity and life,   That knows no term, cessation, or decay;   That fades not when the lamp of earthly life,   Extinguish'd in the dampness of the grave,   Awhile there slumbers, more than when the babe   In the dim newness of its being feels   The impulses of sublunary things,   And all is wonder to unpractis'd sense:   But, active, steadfast and eternal, still   Guides the fierce whirlwind, in the tempest roars,   Cheers in the day, breathes in the balmy groves,   Strengthens in health, and poisons in disease;   And in the storm of change, that ceaselessly   Rolls round the eternal universe and shakes   Its undecaying battlement, presides,   Apportioning with irresistible law   The place each spring of its machine shall fill;   So that when waves on waves tumultuous heap   Confusion to the clouds, and fiercely driven   Heaven's lightnings scorch the uprooted ocean-fords,   Whilst, to the eye of shipwreck'd mariner,   Lone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock,   All seems unlink'd contingency and chance,   No atom of this turbulence fulfils   A vague and unnecessitated task,   Or acts but as it must and ought to act.   Even the minutest molecule of light,   That in an April sunbeam's fleeting glow   Fulfils its destin'd, though invisible work,   The universal Spirit guides; nor less,   When merciless ambition, or mad zeal,   Has led two hosts of dupes to battlefield,   That, blind, they there may dig each other's graves,   And call the sad work glory, does it rule   All passions: not a thought, a will, an act,   No working of the tyrant's moody mind,   Nor one misgiving of the slaves who boast   Their servitude to hide the shame they feel,   Nor the events enchaining every will,   That from the depths of unrecorded time   Have drawn all-influencing virtue, pass   Unrecogniz'd or unforeseen by thee,   Soul of the Universe! eternal spring   Of life and death, of happiness and woe,   Of all that chequers the phantasmal scene   That floats before our eyes in wavering light,   Which gleams but on the darkness of our prison,       Whose chains and massy walls       We feel, but cannot see.   ""Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power,   Necessity! thou mother of the world!   Unlike the God of human error, thou   Requir'st no prayers or praises; the caprice   Of man's weak will belongs no more to thee   Than do the changeful passions of his breast   To thy unvarying harmony: the slave,   Whose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the world,    And the good man, who lifts with virtuous pride   His being in the sight of happiness   That springs from his own works; the poison-tree,   Beneath whose shade all life is wither'd up,   And the fair oak, whose leafy dome affords   A temple where the vows of happy love   Are register'd, are equal in thy sight:   No love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge   And favouritism, and worst desire of fame   Thou know'st not: all that the wide world contains   Are but thy passive instruments, and thou   Regard'st them all with an impartial eye,   Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel,       Because thou hast not human sense,       Because thou art not human mind.       ""Yes! when the sweeping storm of time   Has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruin'd fanes   And broken altars of the almighty Fiend   Whose name usurps thy honours, and the blood   Through centuries clotted there has floated down   The tainted flood of ages, shalt thou live   Unchangeable! A shrine is rais'd to thee,       Which, nor the tempest-breath of time,       Nor the interminable flood       Over earth's slight pageant rolling,          Availeth to destroy--   The sensitive extension of the world.       That wondrous and eternal fane,   Where pain and pleasure, good and evil join,   To do the will of strong necessity,       And life, in multitudinous shapes,   Still pressing forward where no term can be,       Like hungry and unresting flame   Curls round the eternal columns of its strength.""

"A Tale Of Society As It Is: From Facts, 1811","                        I.She was an aged woman; and the yearsWhich she had numbered on her toilsome wayHad bowed her natural powers to decay.She was an aged woman; yet the rayWhich faintly glimmered through her starting tears, Pressed into light by silent misery,Hath soul's imperishable energy.She was a cripple, and incapableTo add one mite to gold-fed luxury:And therefore did her spirit dimly feel That poverty, the crime of tainting stain,Would merge her in its depths, never to rise again.II.One only son's love had supported her.She long had struggled with infirmity,Lingering to human life-scenes; for to die, When fate has spared to rend some mental tie,Would many wish, and surely fewer dare.But, when the tyrant's bloodhounds forced the childFor his cursed power unhallowed arms to wield--Bend to another's will--become a thingMore senseless than the sword of battlefield--Then did she feel keen sorrow's keenest sting;And many years had passed ere comfort they would bring.III.For seven years did this poor woman liveIn unparticipated solitude. Thou mightst have seen her in the forest rudePicking the scattered remnants of its wood.If human, thou mightst then have learned to grieve.The gleanings of precarious charityHer scantiness of food did scarce supply. The proofs of an unspeaking sorrow dweltWithin her ghastly hollowness of eye:Each arrow of the season's change she felt.Yet still she groans, ere yet her race were run,One only hope: it was—once more to see her son. IV.It was an eve of June, when every starSpoke peace from Heaven to those on earth that live.She rested on the moor. 'Twas such an eveWhen first her soul began indeed to grieve:Then he was here; now he is very far. The sweetness of the balmy eveningA sorrow o'er her aged soul did fling,Yet not devoid of rapture’s mingled tear:A balm was in the poison of the sting.This aged sufferer for many a year Had never felt such comfort. She suppressedA sigh--and turning round, clasped William to her breast!V.And, though his form was wasted by the woeWhich tyrants on their victims love to wreak,Though his sunk eyeballs and his faded cheek Of slavery's violence and scorn did speak,Yet did the aged woman's bosom glow.The vital fire seemed re-illumed withinBy this sweet unexpected welcoming.Oh, consummation of the fondest hope That ever soared on Fancy's wildest wing!Oh, tenderness that foundst so sweet a scope!Prince who dost pride thee on thy mighty sway,When THOU canst feel such love, thou shalt be great as they!VI.Her son, compelled, the country's foes had fought, Had bled in battle; and the stern controlWhich ruled his sinews and coerced his soulUtterly poisoned life's unmingled bowl,And unsubduable evils on him brought.He was the shadow of the lusty child Who, when the time of summer season smiled,Did earn for her a meal of honesty,And with affectionate discourse beguiledThe keen attacks of pain and poverty;Till Power, as envying her this only joy,From her maternal bosom tore the unhappy boy.VII.And now cold charity's unwelcome doleWas insufficient to support the pair;And they would perish rather than would bearThe law's stern slavery, and the insolent stare With which law loves to rend the poor man's soul--The bitter scorn, the spirit-sinking noiseOf heartless mirth which women, men, and boysWake in this scene of legal misery....

Epipsychidion (Excerpt),"                                Emily,     A ship is floating in the harbour now,    A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;    There is a path on the sea's azure floor,    No keel has ever plough'd that path before;    The halcyons brood around the foamless isles;    The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;    The merry mariners are bold and free:    Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?  Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest  Is a far Eden of the purple East;  And we between her wings will sit, while Night,  And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,  Our ministers, along the boundless Sea,  Treading each other's heels, unheededly.  It is an isle under Ionian skies,  Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise,  And, for the harbours are not safe and good,  This land would have remain'd a solitude  But for some pastoral people native there,  Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air  Draw the last spirit of the age of gold,  Simple and spirited; innocent and bold.  The blue Aegean girds this chosen home,  With ever-changing sound and light and foam,  Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;  And all the winds wandering along the shore  Undulate with the undulating tide:  There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;  And many a fountain, rivulet and pond,  As clear as elemental diamond,  Or serene morning air; and far beyond,  The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer  (Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)  Pierce into glades, caverns and bowers, and halls  Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls  Illumining, with sound that never fails  Accompany the noonday nightingales;  And all the place is peopled with sweet airs;  The light clear element which the isle wears  Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,  Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers,  And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;  And from the moss violets and jonquils peep  And dart their arrowy odour through the brain  Till you might faint with that delicious pain.  And every motion, odour, beam and tone,  With that deep music is in unison:  Which is a soul within the soul--they seem  Like echoes of an antenatal dream.  It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth and Sea,  Cradled and hung in clear tranquillity;  Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,  Wash'd by the soft blue Oceans of young air.  It is a favour'd place. Famine or Blight,  Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light  Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they  Sail onward far upon their fatal way:  The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm    To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm  Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew,  From which its fields and woods ever renew  Their green and golden immortality.  And from the sea there rise, and from the sky  There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,  Veil after veil, each hiding some delight,  Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,  Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride  Glowing at once with love and loveliness,  Blushes and trembles at its own excess:  Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less  Burns in the heart of this delicious isle,  An atom of th' Eternal, whose own smile  Unfolds itself, and may be felt not seen  O'er the gray rocks, blue waves and forests green,  Filling their bare and void interstices.  But the chief marvel of the wilderness  Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how  None of the rustic island-people know:  'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height  It overtops the woods; but, for delight,  Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime  Had been invented, in the world's young prime,  Rear'd it, a wonder of that simple time,  An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house  Made sacred to his sister and his spouse.  It scarce seems now a wreck of human art,  But, as it were, Titanic; in the heart  Of Earth having assum'd its form, then grown  Out of the mountains, from the living stone,  Lifting itself in caverns light and high:  For all the antique and learned imagery  Has been eras'd, and in the place of it  The ivy and the wild-vine interknit  The volumes of their many-twining stems;  Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems  The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky  Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery  With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,  Or fragments of the day's intense serene;  Working mosaic on their Parian floors.  And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers  And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem  To sleep in one another's arms, and dream  Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we  Read in their smiles, and call reality.    This isle and house are mine, and I have vow'd  Thee to be lady of the solitude.  And I have fitted up some chambers there  Looking towards the golden Eastern air,  And level with the living winds, which flow  Like waves above the living waves below.  I have sent books and music there, and all  Those instruments with which high Spirits call  The future from its cradle, and the past  Out of its grave, and make the present last  In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,  Folded within their own eternity.  Our simple life wants little, and true taste  Hires not the pale drudge Luxury to waste  The scene it would adorn, and therefore still,  Nature with all her children haunts the hill.  The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet  Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit  Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance  Between the quick bats in their twilight dance;  The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight  Before our gate, and the slow, silent night  Is measur'd by the pants of their calm sleep.  Be this our home in life, and when years heap  Their wither'd hours, like leaves, on our decay,  Let us become the overhanging day,  The living soul of this Elysian isle,  Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile  We two will rise, and sit, and walk together,  Under the roof of blue Ionian weather,  And wander in the meadows, or ascend  The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend  With lightest winds, to touch their paramour;  Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore,  Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea,  Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy--  Possessing and possess'd by all that is  Within that calm circumference of bliss,  And by each other, till to love and live  Be one: or, at the noontide hour, arrive  Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep  The moonlight of the expir'd night asleep,  Through which the awaken'd day can never peep;  A veil for our seclusion, close as night's,  Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights;  Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain  Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again.  And we will talk, until thought's melody  Become too sweet for utterance, and it die  In words, to live again in looks, which dart  With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,  Harmonizing silence without a sound.  Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,  And our veins beat together; and our lips  With other eloquence than words, eclipse  The soul that burns between them, and the wells  Which boil under our being's inmost cells,  The fountains of our deepest life, shall be  Confus'd in Passion's golden purity,  As mountain-springs under the morning sun.  We shall become the same, we shall be one  Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?  One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,  Till like two meteors of expanding flame,  Those spheres instinct with it become the same,  Touch, mingle, are transfigur'd; ever still  Burning, yet ever inconsumable:  In one another's substance finding food,  Like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd  To nourish their bright lives with baser prey,  Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away:  One hope within two wills, one will beneath  Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,  One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,  And one annihilation. Woe is me!  The winged words on which my soul would pierce  Into the height of Love's rare Universe,  Are chains of lead around its flight of fire--  I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!

Mont Blanc: Lines Written In The Vale Of Chamouni,"                        I     The everlasting universe of things     Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,    Now dark--now glittering--now reflecting gloom--    Now lending splendour, where from secret springs    The source of human thought its tribute brings    Of waters--with a sound but half its own,    Such as a feeble brook will oft assume,    In the wild woods, among the mountains lone,    Where waterfalls around it leap for ever,   Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river   Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.II   Thus thou, Ravine of Arve--dark, deep Ravine--   Thou many-colour'd, many-voiced vale,   Over whose pines, and crags, and caverns sail   Fast cloud-shadows and sunbeams: awful scene,   Where Power in likeness of the Arve comes down   From the ice-gulfs that gird his secret throne,   Bursting through these dark mountains like the flame   Of lightning through the tempest;--thou dost lie,   Thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging,   Children of elder time, in whose devotion   The chainless winds still come and ever came   To drink their odours, and their mighty swinging   To hear--an old and solemn harmony;   Thine earthly rainbows stretch'd across the sweep   Of the aethereal waterfall, whose veil   Robes some unsculptur'd image; the strange sleep   Which when the voices of the desert fail   Wraps all in its own deep eternity;   Thy caverns echoing to the Arve's commotion,   A loud, lone sound no other sound can tame;   Thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion,   Thou art the path of that unresting sound--   Dizzy Ravine! and when I gaze on thee   I seem as in a trance sublime and strange   To muse on my own separate fantasy,   My own, my human mind, which passively   Now renders and receives fast influencings,   Holding an unremitting interchange   With the clear universe of things around;   One legion of wild thoughts, whose wandering wings   Now float above thy darkness, and now rest   Where that or thou art no unbidden guest,   In the still cave of the witch Poesy,   Seeking among the shadows that pass by   Ghosts of all things that are, some shade of thee,   Some phantom, some faint image; till the breast   From which they fled recalls them, thou art there!III   Some say that gleams of a remoter world   Visit the soul in sleep, that death is slumber,   And that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber   Of those who wake and live.--I look on high;   Has some unknown omnipotence unfurl'd   The veil of life and death? or do I lie   In dream, and does the mightier world of sleep   Spread far around and inaccessibly   Its circles? For the very spirit fails,   Driven like a homeless cloud from steep to steep   That vanishes among the viewless gales!    Far, far above, piercing the infinite sky,   Mont Blanc appears--still, snowy, and serene;   Its subject mountains their unearthly forms   Pile around it, ice and rock; broad vales between   Of frozen floods, unfathomable deeps,   Blue as the overhanging heaven, that spread   And wind among the accumulated steeps;   A desert peopled by the storms alone,   Save when the eagle brings some hunter's bone,   And the wolf tracks her there--how hideously   Its shapes are heap'd around! rude, bare, and high,   Ghastly, and scarr'd, and riven.--Is this the scene   Where the old Earthquake-daemon taught her young   Ruin? Were these their toys? or did a sea   Of fire envelop once this silent snow?   None can reply--all seems eternal now.   The wilderness has a mysterious tongue   Which teaches awful doubt, or faith so mild,   So solemn, so serene, that man may be,   But for such faith, with Nature reconcil'd;   Thou hast a voice, great Mountain, to repeal   Large codes of fraud and woe; not understood   By all, but which the wise, and great, and good   Interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel.IV   The fields, the lakes, the forests, and the streams,   Ocean, and all the living things that dwell   Within the daedal earth; lightning, and rain,   Earthquake, and fiery flood, and hurricane,   The torpor of the year when feeble dreams   Visit the hidden buds, or dreamless sleep   Holds every future leaf and flower; the bound   With which from that detested trance they leap;   The works and ways of man, their death and birth,   And that of him and all that his may be;   All things that move and breathe with toil and sound   Are born and die; revolve, subside, and swell.   Power dwells apart in its tranquillity,   Remote, serene, and inaccessible:   And this, the naked countenance of earth,   On which I gaze, even these primeval mountains  Teach the adverting mind. The glaciers creep  Like snakes that watch their prey, from their far fountains,  Slow rolling on; there, many a precipice  Frost and the Sun in scorn of mortal power  Have pil'd: dome, pyramid, and pinnacle,  A city of death, distinct with many a tower  And wall impregnable of beaming ice.  Yet not a city, but a flood of ruin  Is there, that from the boundaries of the sky  Rolls its perpetual stream; vast pines are strewing  Its destin'd path, or in the mangled soil  Branchless and shatter'd stand; the rocks, drawn down  From yon remotest waste, have overthrown  The limits of the dead and living world,  Never to be reclaim'd. The dwelling-place  Of insects, beasts, and birds, becomes its spoil;  Their food and their retreat for ever gone,  So much of life and joy is lost. The race  Of man flies far in dread; his work and dwelling  Vanish, like smoke before the tempest's stream,  And their place is not known. Below, vast caves  Shine in the rushing torrents' restless gleam,  Which from those secret chasms in tumult welling  Meet in the vale, and one majestic River,  The breath and blood of distant lands, for ever  Rolls its loud waters to the ocean-waves,  Breathes its swift vapours to the circling air.V  Mont Blanc yet gleams on high:--the power is there,  The still and solemn power of many sights,  And many sounds, and much of life and death.  In the calm darkness of the moonless nights,  In the lone glare of day, the snows descend  Upon that Mountain; none beholds them there,  Nor when the flakes burn in the sinking sun,  Or the star-beams dart through them. Winds contend  Silently there, and heap the snow with breath  Rapid and strong, but silently! Its home  The voiceless lightning in these solitudes  Keeps innocently, and like vapour broods  Over the snow. The secret Strength of things  Which governs thought, and to the infinite dome  Of Heaven is as a law, inhabits thee!  And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea,  If to the human mind's imaginings  Silence and solitude were vacancy?                                             "
An Allegory,"                        I.A portal as of shadowy adamantStands yawning on the highway of the lifeWhich we all tread, a cavern huge and gaunt;Around it rages an unceasing strifeOf shadows, like the restless clouds that haunt The gap of some cleft mountain, lifted highInto the whirlwinds of the upper sky.II.And many pass it by with careless tread,Not knowing that a shadowy...Tracks every traveller even to where the dead Wait peacefully for their companion new;But others, by more curious humour led,Pause to examine;—these are very few,And they learn little there, except to knowThat shadows follow them where’er they go.

The Witch Of Atlas,"                        Before those cruel twins whom at one birth     Incestuous Change bore to her father Time,Error and Truth, had hunted from the earth     All those bright natures which adorned its prime,And left us nothing to believe in, worth     The pains of putting into learn?d rhyme,A Lady Witch there lived on Atlas mountainWithin a cavern by a secret fountain.Her mother was one of the Atlantides.     The all-beholding Sun had ne'er beholdenIn his wide voyage o'er continents and seas     So fair a creature, as she lay enfoldenIn the warm shadow of her loveliness;     He kissed her with his beams, and made all goldenThe chamber of gray rock in which she lay.She, in that dream of joy, dissolved away.'Tis said she first was changed into a vapor;     And then into a cloud,--such clouds as flit(Like splendor-winged moths about a taper)     Round the red west when the Sun dies in it;And then into a meteor, such as caper     On hill-tops when the Moon is in a fit;Then into one of those mysterious starsWhich hide themselves between the Earth and Mars.Ten times the Mother of the Months had ben     Her bow beside the folding-star, and biddenWith that bright sign the billows to indent     The sea-deserted sand--(like children chidden,At her command they ever came and went)--     Since in that cave a dewy splendor hiddenTook shape and motion.  With the living formOf this embodied Power the cave grew warm.A lovely Lady garmented in light     From her own beauty: deep her eyes as areTwo openings of unfathomable night     Seen through a temple's cloven roof; her hairDark; the dim brain whirls dizzy with delight,     Picturing her form. Her soft smiles shone afar;And her low voice was heard like love, and drewAll living things towards this wonder new.And first the spotted cameleopard came;     And then the wise and fearless elephant;Then the sly serpent, in the golden flame     Of his own volumes intervolved. All gauntAnd sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame,--     They drank before her at her sacred fount;And every beast of beating heart grew bold,Such gentleness and power even to behold.The brinded lioness led forth her young,     That she might teach them how they should foregoTheir inborn thirst of death; the pard unstrung     His sinews at her feet, and sought to know,With looks whose motions spoke without a tongue,     How he might be as gentle as the doe.The magic circle of her voice and eyesAll savage natures did imparadise.And old Silenus, shaking a green stick     Of lilies, and the Wood-gods in a crew,Came blithe as in the olive-copses thick     Cicade are, drunk with the noonday dew;And Dryope and Faunus followed quick,     Teazing the God to sing them something new;Till in this cave they found the Lady lone,Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there.     And, though none saw him,--through the adamantOf the deep mountains, through the trackless air,     And through those living spirits like a want,--He passed out of his everlasting lair     Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,And felt that wondrous Lady all alone,--And she felt him upon her emerald throne.And every Nymph of stream and spreading tree,     And every Shepherdess of Ocean's flocksWho drives her white waves over the green sea,     And Ocean with the brine on his grey locks,And quaint Priapus with his company,--     All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocksCould have brought forth so beautiful a birth:Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.The herdsmen and the mountain-maidens came,     And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--Their spirits shook within them, as a flame     Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:Pygmies and Polyphemes, by many a name,     Centaurs and Satyrs, and such shapes as hauntWet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.For she was beautiful. Her beauty made     The bright world dim, and everything besideSeemed like the fleeting image of a shade.     No thought of living spirit could abide(Which to her looks had ever been betrayed)     On any object in the world so wide,On any hope within the circling skies,--But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.Which when the Lady knew; she took her spindle,     And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and threeLong lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle     The clouds and waves and mountains with, and sheAs many starbeams, ere their lamps could dwindle     In the belated moon, wound skilfully;And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--A shadow for the splendour of her love.The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling     Were stored with magic treasures:--sounds of airWhich had the power all spirits of compelling,     Folded in cells of crystal silence there;Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling     will never die--yet, ere we are aware,The feeling and the sound are fled and goneAnd the regret they leave remains alone.And there lay Visions swift and sweet and quaint,     Each in its thin sheath like a chrysalis;--Some eager to burst forth; some weak and faint     With the soft burden of intensest blissIt is their work to bear to many a saint      Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,Even Love's; and others, white, green, grey, and black,And of all shapes:--and each was at her beck.And odours in a kind of aviary     Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,Clipped in a floating net a love-sick Fairy     Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept.As bats at the wired window of a dairy,     They beat their vans; and each was an adept--When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds--To stir sweet thoughts or sad in destined minds.And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might     Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,And change eternal death into a night     Of glorious dreams--or, if eyes needs must weep,Could make their tears all wonder and delight--     She in her crystal phials did closely keep:If men could drink of those clear phials, 'tis saidThe living were not envied of the dead.Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,     The works of some Saturnian Archimage,Which taught the expiations at whose price     Men from the Gods might win that happy ageToo lightly lost, redeeming native vice,--     And which might quench the earth-consuming rageOf gold and blood, till men should live and moveHarmonious as the sacred stars above:--And how all things that seem untameable,     Not to be checked and not to be confined,Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;     Time, earth, and fire, the ocean and the wind,And all their shapes, and man's imperial will;--     And other scrolls whose writings did unbindThe inmost lore of love--let the profaneTremble to ask what secrets they contain.And wondrous works of substances unknown,     To which the enchantment of her Father's powerHad changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,     Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;Carved lamps and chalices, and phials which shone     In their own golden beams--each like a flowerOut of whose depth a firefly shakes his lightUnder a cypress in a starless night.At first she lived alone in this wild home,     And her own thoughts were each a minister,Clothing themselves or with the ocean-foam,     Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,To work whatever purposes might come     Into her mind: such power her mighty SireHad girt them with, whether to fly or runThrough all the regions which he shines upon.The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,     Oreads, and Naiads with long weedy locks,Offered to do her bidding through the seas,     Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,And far beneath the matted roots of trees,     And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks;So they might live for ever in the lightOf her sweet presence--each a satellite.""This may not be,"" the Wizard Maid replied.     ""The fountains where the Naiades bedewTheir shining hair at length are drained and dried;     The solid oaks forget their strength, and strewTheir latest leaf upon the mountains wide;     The boundless ocean like a drop of dewWill be consumed; the stubborn centre mustBe scattered like a cloud of summer dust.""And ye, with them, will perish one by one.     If I must sigh to think that this shall be,If I must weep when the surviving Sun     Shall smile on your decay--oh ask not meTo love you till your little race is run;     I cannot die as ye must.--Over meYour leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwellShall be my paths henceforth; and so farewell.""She spoke and wept. The dark and azure well     Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,And every little circlet where they fell     Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheresAnd intertangled lines of light. A knell     Of sobbing voices came upon her earsFrom those departing forms, o'er the sereneOf the white streams and of the forest green.All day the Wizard Lady sat aloof;     Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquityUnder the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;     Or broidering the pictured poesyOf some high tale upon her growing woof,     Which the sweet splendor of her smiles could dyeIn hues outshining heaven--and ever sheAdded some grace to the wrought poesy:--While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece     Of sandal-wood, rare gums, and cinnamon.Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is;     Each flame of it is as a precious stoneDissolved in ever-moving light, and this     Belongs to each and all who gaze thereon.'The Witch beheld it not, for in her handShe held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.This Lady never slept, but lay in trance     All night within the fountain--as in sleep.Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance:     Through the green splendour of the water deepShe saw the constellations reel and dance     Like fireflies--and withal did ever keepThe tenor of her contemplations calm,With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.And, when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended     From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,She passed at dewfall to a space extended,     Where, in a lawn of flowering asphodelAmid a wood of pines and cedars blended,     There yawned an inextinguishable wellOf crimson fire, full even to the brim,And overflowing all the margin trim:--Within the which she lay when the fierce war     Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor,In many a mimic moon and bearded star,     O'er woods and lawns. The serpent heard it flickerIn sleep, and, dreaming still, he crept afar.     And, when the windless snow descended thickerThan autumn-leaves, she watched it as it cameMelt on the surface of the level flame.She had a boat which some say Vulcan wrought     For Venus, as the chariot of her star;But it was found too feeble to be fraught     With all the ardours in that sphere which are,And so she sold it, and Apollo bought     And gave it to this daughter: from a car,Changed to the fairest and the lightest boatWhich ever upon mortal stream did float.And others say that, when but three hours old,     The firstborn Love out of his cradle leapt,And clove dun chaos with his wings of gold,     And, like a horticultural adept,Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,     And sowed it in his mother's star, and keptWatering it all the summer with sweet dew,And with his wings fanning it as it grew.The plant grew strong and green--the snowy flower     Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit beganTo turn the light and dew by inward power     To its own substance: woven tracery ranOf light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er     The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan,--Of which Love scooped this boat, and with soft motionPiloted it round the circumfluous ocean.This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit     A living spirit within all its frame,Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.     Couched on the fountain--like a panther tame(One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit,     Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame,Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought--In joyous expectation lay the boat.Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow     Together, tempering the repugnant massWith liquid love--all things together grow     Through which the harmony of love can pass;And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--     A living image which did far surpassIn beauty that bright shape of vital stoneWhich drew the heart out of Pygmalion.A sexless thing it was, and in its growth     It seemed to have developed no defectOf either sex, yet all the grace of both.     In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;The bosom lightly swelled with its full youth;     The countenance was such as might selectSome artist that his skill should never die,lmaging forth such perfect purity.From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings     Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,     Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere.She led her creature to the boiling springs     Where the light boat was moored, and said ""Sit here,""And pointed to the prow, and took her seatBeside the rudder with opposing feet.And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,     Around their inland islets, and amidThe panther-peopled forests (whose shade cast     Darkness and odors, and a pleasure hidIn melancholy gloom) the pinnace passed;     By many a star-surrounded pyramidOf icy crag cleaving the purple sky,And caverns yawning round unfathomably.The silver noon into that winding dell,     With slanted gleam athwart the forest-tops,Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;     A green and glowing light, like that which dropsFrom folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell     When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;Between the severed mountains lay on high,Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.And, ever as she went, the Image lay     With folded wings and unawakened eyes;And o'er its gentle countenance did play     The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,     And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighsInhaling, which with busy murmur vainThey has aroused from that full heart and brain.And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud     Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:Now lingering on the pools, in which abode     The calm and darkness of the deep contentIn which they paused; now o'er the shallow road     Of white and dancing waters, all besprentWith sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boatIn such a shallow rapid could not float.And down the earthquaking cataracts, which shivcr     Their snow-like waters into golden air,Or under chasms unfathomable ever     Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tearA subterranean portal for the river,     It fled. The circling sunbows did upbearIts fall down the hoar precipice of spray,Lighting it far upon its lampless way.And, when the Wizard Lady would ascend     The labyrinths of some many-winding valeWhich to the inmost mountain upward tend,     She called ""Hermaphroditus!""--and the paleAnd heavy hue which slumber could extend     Over its lips and eyes, as on the galeA rapid shadow from a slope of grass,Into the darkness of the stream did passAnd it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions;     With stars of fire spotting the stream below,And from above into the Sun's dominions     Flinging a glory like the golden glowIn which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,     All interwoven with fine feathery snow,And moonlight splendour of intensest rimeWith which frost paints the pines in winter-time.And then it winnowed the elysian air     Which ever hung about that Lady bright,With its etherial vans: and, speeding there,     Like a star up the torrent of the night,Or a swift eagle in the morning glare     Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.The water flashed,--like sunlight, by the prow     Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to heaven;The still air seemed as if its waves did flow     In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven,The Lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro;     Beneath, the billows, having vainly strivenIndignant and impetuous, roared to feelThe swift and steady motion of the keel.Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,     Or in the noon of interlunar night,The Lady Witch in visions could not chain     Her spirit; but sailed forth under the lightOf shooting stars, and bade extend amain     Its storm-outspeeding wings the Hermaphrodite;She to the austral waters took her way,Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana.Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,     Which rain could never bend or whirlblast shake,With the antarctic constellations paven,     Canopus and his crew, lay the austral lake--There she would build herself a windless haven     Out of the clouds whose moving turrets makeThe bastions of the storm, when through the skyThe spirits of the tempest thundered by:--A haven beneath whose translucent floor     The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably;And around which the solid vapours hoar,     Based on the level waters, to the skyLifted their dreadful crags, and, like a shore     Of wintry mountains, inaccessiblyHemmed-in with rifts and precipices grey,And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.And, whilst the outer lake beneath the lash     Of the wind's scourge foamed like a wounded thingAnd the incessant hail with stony clash     Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wingOf the roused cormorant in the lightningflash     Looked like the wreck of some wind-wanderingFragment of inky thunder-smoke--this havenWas as a gem to copy heaven engraven.On which that Lady played her many pranks,     Circling the image of a shooting star(Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks     Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are)In her light boat; and many quips and cranks     She played upon the water; till the carOf the late moon, like a sick matron wan,To journey from the misty east began.And then she called out of the hollow turrets     Of those high clouds, white, golden, and vermilion,The armies of her ministering spirits.     In mighty legions million after millionThey came, each troop emblazoning its merits     On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilionOf the intertexture of the atmosphereThey pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen     Of woven exhalations, underlaidWith lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen     A dome of thin and open ivory inlaidWith crimson silk. Cressets from the serene     Hung there, and on the water for her treadA tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught     Upon those wandering isles of aery dewWhich highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,     She sate, and heard all that had happened newBetween the earth and moon since they had brought     The last intelligence: and now she grewPale as that moon lost in the watery night,And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.These were tame pleasures.--She would often climb     The steepest ladder of the crudded rackUp to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,     And like Arion on the dolphin's backRide singing through the shoreless air. Oft-time,     Following the serpent lightning's winding track,She ran upon the platforms of the wind,And laughed to hear the fireballs roar behid.And sometimes to those streams of upper air     Which whirl the earth in its diurnal roundShe would ascend, and win the Spirits there     To let her join their chorus. Mortals foundThat on those days the sky was calm and fair,     And mystic snatches of harmonious soundWandered upon the earth where'er she passed,And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,     To glide adown old Nilus, where he threadsEgypt and Ethiopia from the steep     Of utmost Axume until he spreads,Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,     His waters on the plain,--and crested headsOf cities and proud temples gleam amid,And many a vapour-belted pyramid:--By MÏris and the Mareotid lakes,     Strewn with faint blooms like bridal-chamber floors,Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,     Or charioteering ghastly alligators,Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes     Of those huge forms;--within the brazen doorsOf the Great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.And where within the surface of the river     The shadows of the massy temples lie,And never are erased, but tremble ever     Like things which every cloud can doom to die,--Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever     The works of man pierced that serenest skyWith tombs and towers and fanes,--'twas her delightTo wander in the shadow of the night.With motion like the spirit of that wind     Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feetPassed through the peopled haunts of humankind,     Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,--Through fane and palace-court, and labyrinth mined     With many a dark and subterranean streetUnder the Nile; through chambers high and deepShe passed, observing mortals in their sleep.A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see     Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.Here lay two sister-twins in infancy;     There a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;Within, two lovers linked innocently     In their loose locks which over both did creepLike ivy from one stem; and there lay calmOld age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,     Not to be mirrored in a holy song,--Distortions foul of supernatural awe,     And pale imaginings of visioned wrong,And all the code of Custom's lawless law     Written upon the brows of old and young.""This,"" said the Wizard Maiden, ""is the strifeWhich stirs the liquid surface of man's life.""And little did the sight disturb her soul.     We, the weak mariners of that wide lake,Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,     Our course unpiloted and starless makeO'er its wild surface to an unknown goal;     But she in the calm depths her way could take,Where in bright bowers immortal forms abideBeneath the weltering of the restless tide.And she saw princes couched under the glow     Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-courtIn dormitories ranged, row after row,     She saw the priests asleep,--all of one sort,For all were educated to be so.     The peasants in their huts, and in the portThe sailors she saw cradled on the waves,And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.And all the forms in which those spirits lay     Were to her sight like the diaphanousVeils in which those sweet ladies oft array     Their delicate limbs who would conceal from usOnly their scorn of all concealment: they     Move in the light of their own beauty thus.But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,And little thought a Witch was looking on them.She all those human figures breathing there     Beheld as living spirits. To her eyesThe naked beauty of the soul lay bare,     And often through a rude and worn disguiseShe saw the inner form most bright and fair:     And then she had a charm of strange device,Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,Could make that spirit mingle with her own.Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given     For such a charm, when Tithon became grey--Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven     Wouldst thou have yielded, ere ProserpinaHad half (oh why not all?) the debt forgiven     Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay--To any witch who would have taught you itThe Heliad doth not know its value yet.'Tis said in after times her spirit free     Knew what love was, and felt itself alone.But holy Dian could not chaster be     Before she stooped to kiss EndymionThan now this Lady,--like a sexless bee,     Tasting all blossoms and confined to none:Among those mortal forms the Wizard MaidenPassed with an eye serene and heart unladen.To those she saw most beautiful she gave     Strange panacea in a crystal bowl.They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,     And lived thenceforward as if some control,Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave     Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,Was as a green and overarching bowerLit by the gems of many a starry flower.For, on the night when they were buried, she     Restored the embalmer's ruining, and shookThe light out of the funeral-lamps, to be     A mimic day within that deathy nook;And she unwound the woven imagery     Of second childhood's swaddling-bands, and tookThe coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,And threw it with contempt into a ditch,And there the body lay, age after age,     Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,Like one asleep in a green hermitage,--     With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,And living in its dreams beyond the rage     Of death or life; while they were still arrayingIn liveries ever new the rapid, blind,And fleeting generations of mankind.And she would write strange dreams upon the brain     Of those who were less beautiful, and makeAll harsh and crooked purposes more vain     Than in the desert is the serpent's wakeWhich the sand covers. All his evil gain     The miser, in such dreams, would rise and shakeInto a beggar's lap; the lying scribeWould his own lies betray without a bribe.The priests would write an explanation full,     Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,How the God Apis really was a bull,     And nothing more; and bid the herald stickThe same against the temple-doors, and pull     The old cant down: they licensed all to speakWhate'er they thought of hawks and cats and geese,By pastoral letters to each diocese.The king would dress an ape up in his crown     And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,And on the right hand of the sunlike throne     Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeatThe chatterings of the monkey. Every one     Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feetOf their great emperor when the morning came;And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!The soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths, and     Walked out of quarters in somnambulism;Round the red anvils you might see them stand     Like Cyclopses in Vulcan's sooty abysm,Beating their swords to ploughshares:--in a band     The jailors sent those of the liberal schismFree through the streets of Memphis--much, I wis,To the annoyance of king Amasis.And timid lovers, who had been so coy     They hardly knew whether they loved or not,Would rise out of their rest, and take sweet joy,     To the fulfilment of their inmost thought;And, when next day the maiden and the boy     Met one another, both, like sinners caught,Blushed at the thing which each believed was doneOnly in fancy--till the tenth moon shone;And then the Witch would let them take no ill;     Of many thousand schemes which lovers find,The Witch found one,--and so they took their fill     Of happiness in marriage warm and kind.Friends who, by practice of some envious skill,     Were torn apart (a wide wound, mind from mind)She did unite again with visions clearOf deep affection and of truth sincere.These were the pranks she played among the cities     Of mortal men. And what she did to SpritesAnd Gods, entangling them in her sweet ditties,     To do her will, and show their subtle sleights,I will declare another time; for it is     A tale more fit for the weird winter-nightsThan for these garish summer-days, when weScarcely believe much more than we can see.

The Two Spirits: An Allegory,"                        FIRST SPIRIT     O thou, who plum'd with strong desire         Wouldst float above the earth, beware!    A Shadow tracks thy flight of fire--           Night is coming!    Bright are the regions of the air,        And among the winds and beams    It were delight to wander there--           Night is coming!SECOND SPIRIT    The deathless stars are bright above;       If I would cross the shade of night,   Within my heart is the lamp of love,          And that is day!   And the moon will smile with gentle light       On my golden plumes where'er they move;   The meteors will linger round my flight,          And make night day.FIRST SPIRIT   But if the whirlwinds of darkness waken       Hail, and lightning, and stormy rain;   See, the bounds of the air are shaken--          Night is coming!   The red swift clouds of the hurricane       Yon declining sun have overtaken,   The clash of the hail sweeps over the plain--          Night is coming!SECOND SPIRIT   I see the light, and I hear the sound;       I'll sail on the flood of the tempest dark,   With the calm within and the light around          Which makes night day:   And thou, when the gloom is deep and stark,       Look from thy dull earth, slumber-bound,   My moon-like flight thou then mayst mark          On high, far away.----   Some say there is a precipice       Where one vast pine is frozen to ruin   O'er piles of snow and chasms of ice          Mid Alpine mountains;   And that the languid storm pursuing       That winged shape, for ever flies   Round those hoar branches, aye renewing          Its aëry fountains.   Some say when nights are dry and dear,       And the death-dews sleep on the morass,   Sweet whispers are heard by the traveller,          Which make night day:   And a silver shape like his early love doth pass       Upborne by her wild and glittering hair,   And when he awakes on the fragrant grass,          He finds night day.

Ode To Liberty,"                        Yet, Freedom, yet, thy banner, torn but flying,Streams like a thunder-storm against the wind.--BYRON.I.A glorious people vibrated againThe lightning of the nations: LibertyFrom heart to heart, from tower to tower, o'er Spain,Scattering contagious fire into the sky,Gleamed. My soul spurned the chains of its dismay, And in the rapid plumes of songClothed itself, sublime and strong;As a young eagle soars the morning clouds among,Hovering inverse o'er its accustomed prey;Till from its station in the Heaven of fameThe Spirit's whirlwind rapped it, and the rayOf the remotest sphere of living flameWhich paves the void was from behind it flung,As foam from a ship's swiftness, when there cameA voice out of the deep: I will record the same.II.The Sun and the serenest Moon sprang forth:The burning stars of the abyss were hurledInto the depths of Heaven. The daedal earth,That island in the ocean of the world,Hung in its cloud of all-sustaining air:But this divinest universeWas yet a chaos and a curse,For thou wert not: but, power from worst producing worse,The spirit of the beasts was kindled there,And of the birds, and of the watery forms,And there was war among them, and despairWithin them, raging without truce or terms:The bosom of their violated nurseGroaned, for beasts warred on beasts, and worms on worms,And men on men; each heart was as a hell of storms.III.Man, the imperial shape, then multipliedHis generations under the pavilionOf the Sun’s throne: palace and pyramid,Temple and prison, to many a swarming millionWere, as to mountain-wolves their ragged caves.This human living multitudeWas savage, cunning, blind, and rude,For thou wert not; but o’er the populous solitude,Like one fierce cloud over a waste of waves,Hung Tyranny; beneath, sate deifiedThe sister-pest, congregator of slaves;Into the shadow of her pinions wideAnarchs and priests, who feed on gold and bloodTill with the stain their inmost souls are dyed,Drove the astonished herds of men from every side.IV.The nodding promontories, and blue isles,And cloud-like mountains, and dividuous wavesOf Greece, basked glorious in the open smilesOf favouring Heaven: from their enchanted cavesProphetic echoes flung dim melody.On the unapprehensive wildThe vine, the corn, the olive mild,Grew savage yet, to human use unreconciled;And, like unfolded flowers beneath the sea,Like the man’s thought dark in the infant’s brain, Like aught that is which wraps what is to be,Art’s deathless dreams lay veiled by many a veinOf Parian stone; and, yet a speechless child,Verse murmured, and Philosophy did strainHer lidless eyes for thee; when o’er the Aegean main.V.Athens arose: a city such as visionBuilds from the purple crags and silver towersOf battlemented cloud, as in derisionOf kingliest masonry: the ocean-floorsPave it; the evening sky pavilions it;Its portals are inhabitedBy thunder-zoned winds, each headWithin its cloudy wings with sun-fire garlanded,--A divine work! Athens, diviner yet,Gleamed with its crest of columns, on the will Of man, as on a mount of diamond, set;For thou wert, and thine all-creative skillPeopled, with forms that mock the eternal deadIn marble immortality, that hillWhich was thine earliest throne and latest oracle. VI.Within the surface of Time’s fleeting riverIts wrinkled image lies, as then it layImmovably unquiet, and for everIt trembles, but it cannot pass away!The voices of thy bards and sages thunderWith an earth-awakening blastThrough the caverns of the past:(Religion veils her eyes; Oppression shrinks aghast):A winged sound of joy, and love, and wonder,Which soars where Expectation never flew, Rending the veil of space and time asunder!One ocean feeds the clouds, and streams, and dew;One Sun illumines Heaven; one Spirit vastWith life and love makes chaos ever new,As Athens doth the world with thy delight renew.VII.Then Rome was, and from thy deep bosom fairest,Like a wolf-cub from a Cadmaean Maenad,She drew the milk of greatness, though thy dearestFrom that Elysian food was yet unweaned;And many a deed of terrible uprightnessBy thy sweet love was sanctified;And in thy smile, and by thy side,Saintly Camillus lived, and firm Atilius died.But when tears stained thy robe of vestal-whiteness,And gold profaned thy Capitolian throne, 100Thou didst desert, with spirit-winged lightness,The senate of the tyrants: they sunk proneSlaves of one tyrant: Palatinus sighedFaint echoes of Ionian song; that toneThou didst delay to hear, lamenting to disown VIII.From what Hyrcanian glen or frozen hill,Or piny promontory of the Arctic main,Or utmost islet inaccessible,Didst thou lament the ruin of thy reign,Teaching the woods and waves, and desert rocks,And every Naiad’s ice-cold urn,To talk in echoes sad and sternOf that sublimest lore which man had dared unlearn?For neither didst thou watch the wizard flocksOf the Scald's dreams, nor haunt the Druid's sleep. What if the tears rained through thy shattered locksWere quickly dried? for thou didst groan, not weep,When from its sea of death, to kill and burn,The Galilean serpent forth did creep,And made thy world an undistinguishable heap.IX.A thousand years the Earth cried, 'Where art thou?'And then the shadow of thy coming fellOn Saxon Alfred’s olive-cinctured brow:And many a warrior-peopled citadel.Like rocks which fire lifts out of the flat deep,Arose in sacred Italy,Frowning o'er the tempestuous seaOf kings, and priests, and slaves, in tower-crowned majesty;That multitudinous anarchy did sweepAnd burst around their walls, like idle foam,Whilst from the human spirit’s deepest deepStrange melody with love and awe struck dumbDissonant arms; and Art, which cannot die,With divine wand traced on our earthly homeFit imagery to pave Heaven’s everlasting dome.X.Thou huntress swifter than the Moon! thou terrorOf the world’s wolves! thou bearer of the quiver,Whose sunlike shafts pierce tempest-winged Error,As light may pierce the clouds when they disseverIn the calm regions of the orient day!Luther caught thy wakening glance;Like lightning, from his leaden lanceReflected, it dissolved the visions of the tranceIn which, as in a tomb, the nations lay;And England’s prophets hailed thee as their queen,In songs whose music cannot pass away,Though it must flow forever: not unseenBefore the spirit-sighted countenanceOf Milton didst thou pass, from the sad sceneBeyond whose night he saw, with a dejected mien. XI.The eager hours and unreluctant yearsAs on a dawn-illumined mountain stood.Trampling to silence their loud hopes and fears,Darkening each other with their multitude,And cried aloud, 'Liberty!' Indignation Answered Pity from her cave;Death grew pale within the grave,And Desolation howled to the destroyer, Save!When like Heaven’s Sun girt by the exhalationOf its own glorious light, thou didst arise. Chasing thy foes from nation unto nationLike shadows: as if day had cloven the skiesAt dreaming midnight o’er the western wave,Men started, staggering with a glad surprise,Under the lightnings of thine unfamiliar eyes. XII.Thou Heaven of earth! what spells could pall thee thenIn ominous eclipse? a thousand yearsBred from the slime of deep Oppression’s den.Dyed all thy liquid light with blood and tears.Till thy sweet stars could weep the stain away; How like Bacchanals of bloodRound France, the ghastly vintage, stoodDestruction's sceptred slaves, and Folly’s mitred brood!When one, like them, but mightier far than they,The Anarch of thine own bewildered powers, Rose: armies mingled in obscure array,Like clouds with clouds, darkening the sacred bowersOf serene Heaven. He, by the past pursued,Rests with those dead, but unforgotten hours,Whose ghosts scare victor kings in their ancestral towers.XIII.England yet sleeps: was she not called of old?Spain calls her now, as with its thrilling thunderVesuvius wakens Aetna, and the coldSnow-crags by its reply are cloven in sunder:O’er the lit waves every Aeolian isle 185From Pithecusa to PelorusHowls, and leaps, and glares in chorus:They cry, 'Be dim; ye lamps of Heaven suspended o'er us!'Her chains are threads of gold, she need but smileAnd they dissolve; but Spain’s were links of steel,Till bit to dust by virtue’s keenest file.Twins of a single destiny! appealTo the eternal years enthroned before usIn the dim West; impress us from a seal,All ye have thought and done! Time cannot dare conceal. XIV.Tomb of Arminius! render up thy deadTill, like a standard from a watch-tower’s staff,His soul may stream over the tyrant’s head;Thy victory shall be his epitaph,Wild Bacchanal of truth’s mysterious wine,King-deluded Germany,His dead spirit lives in thee.Why do we fear or hope? thou art already free!And thou, lost Paradise of this divineAnd glorious world! thou flowery wilderness!Thou island of eternity! thou shrineWhere Desolation, clothed with loveliness,Worships the thing thou wert! O Italy,Gather thy blood into thy heart; repressThe beasts who make their dens thy sacred palaces.XV.Oh, that the free would stamp the impious nameOf KING into the dust! or write it there,So that this blot upon the page of fameWere as a serpent’s path, which the light airErases, and the flat sands close behind! Ye the oracle have heard:Lift the victory-flashing sword.And cut the snaky knots of this foul gordian word,Which, weak itself as stubble, yet can bindInto a mass, irrefragably firm,The axes and the rods which awe mankind;The sound has poison in it, ’tis the spermOf what makes life foul, cankerous, and abhorred;Disdain not thou, at thine appointed term,To set thine armed heel on this reluctant worm.XVI.Oh, that the wise from their bright minds would kindleSuch lamps within the dome of this dim world,That the pale name of PRIEST might shrink and dwindleInto the hell from which it first was hurled,A scoff of impious pride from fiends impure; Till human thoughts might kneel alone,Each before the judgement-throneOf its own aweless soul, or of the Power unknown!Oh, that the words which make the thoughts obscureFrom which they spring, as clouds of glimmering dew From a white lake blot Heaven’s blue portraiture,Were stripped of their thin masks and various hueAnd frowns and smiles and splendours not their own,Till in the nakedness of false and trueThey stand before their Lord, each to receive its due! XVII.He who taught man to vanquish whatsoeverCan be between the cradle and the graveCrowned him the King of Life. Oh, vain endeavour!If on his own high will, a willing slave,He has enthroned the oppression and the oppressor What if earth can clothe and feedAmplest millions at their need,And power in thought be as the tree within the seed?Or what if Art, an ardent intercessor,Driving on fiery wings to Nature’s throne,Checks the great mother stooping to caress her,And cries: ‘Give me, thy child, dominionOver all height and depth’? if Life can breedNew wants, and wealth from those who toil and groan,Rend of thy gifts and hers a thousandfold for one!XVIII.Come thou, but lead out of the inmost caveOf man’s deep spirit, as the morning-starBeckons the Sun from the Eoan wave,Wisdom. I hear the pennons of her carSelf-moving, like cloud charioted by flame;Comes she not, and come ye not,Rulers of eternal thought,To judge, with solemn truth, life’s ill-apportioned lot?Blind Love, and equal Justice, and the FameOf what has been, the Hope of what will be?O Liberty! if such could be thy nameWert thou disjoined from these, or they from thee:If thine or theirs were treasures to be boughtBy blood or tears, have not the wise and freeWept tears, and blood like tears?—The solemn harmony XIX.Paused, and the Spirit of that mighty singingTo its abyss was suddenly withdrawn;Then, as a wild swan, when sublimely wingingIts path athwart the thunder-smoke of dawn,Sinks headlong through the aereal golden lightOn the heavy-sounding plain,When the bolt has pierced its brain;As summer clouds dissolve, unburthened of their rain;As a far taper fades with fading night,As a brief insect dies with dying day,--My song, its pinions disarrayed of might,Drooped; o’er it closed the echoes far awayOf the great voice which did its flight sustain,As waves which lately paved his watery wayHiss round a drowner’s head in their tempestuous play.

Hellas,"                        THE world's great age begins anew,    The golden years return, The earth doth like a snake renew    Her winter weeds outworn; Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam Like wrecks of a dissolving dream. A brighter Hellas rears its mountains    From waves serener far; A new Peneus rolls his fountains    Against the morning star; Where fairer Tempes bloom, there sleep Young Cyclads on a sunnier deep. A loftier Argo cleaves the main,    Fraught with a later prize; Another Orpheus sings again,    And loves, and weeps, and dies; A new Ulysses leaves once more Calypso for his native shore. O write no more the tale of Troy,    If earth Death's scroll must be-- Nor mix with Laian rage the joy    Which dawns upon the free, Although a subtler Sphinx renew Riddles of death Thebes never knew. Another Athens shall arise,    And to remoter time Bequeath, like sunset to the skies,    The splendour of its prime; And leave, if naught so bright may live, All earth can take or Heaven can give. Saturn and Love their long repose    Shall burst, more bright and good Than all who fell, than One who rose,    Than many unsubdued: Not gold, not blood, their altar dowers, But votive tears and symbol flowers. O cease! must hate and death return?    Cease! must men kill and die? Cease! drain not to its dregs the urn    Of bitter prophecy! The world is weary of the past-- O might it die or rest at last!                                             "
The Triumph Of Life,"                            Swift as a spirit hastening to his task     Of glory & of good, the Sun sprang forth    Rejoicing in his splendour, & the mask    Of darkness fell from the awakened Earth.    The smokeless altars of the mountain snows    Flamed above crimson clouds, & at the birth    Of light, the Ocean's orison arose    To which the birds tempered their matin lay,    All flowers in field or forest which unclose  Their trembling eyelids to the kiss of day,  Swinging their censers in the element,  With orient incense lit by the new ray  Burned slow & inconsumably, & sent  Their odorous sighs up to the smiling air,  And in succession due, did Continent,  Isle, Ocean, & all things that in them wear  The form & character of mortal mould  Rise as the Sun their father rose, to bear  Their portion of the toil which he of old  Took as his own & then imposed on them;  But I, whom thoughts which must remain untold  Had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem  The cone of night, now they were laid asleep,  Stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem  Which an old chestnut flung athwart the steep  Of a green Apennine: before me fled  The night; behind me rose the day; the Deep  Was at my feet, & Heaven above my head  When a strange trance over my fancy grew  Which was not slumber, for the shade it spread  Was so transparent that the scene came through  As clear as when a veil of light is drawn  O'er evening hills they glimmer; and I knew  That I had felt the freshness of that dawn,  Bathed in the same cold dew my brow & hair  And sate as thus upon that slope of lawn  Under the self same bough, & heard as there  The birds, the fountains & the Ocean hold  Sweet talk in music through the enamoured air.  And then a Vision on my brain was rolled.  As in that trance of wondrous thought I lay  This was the tenour of my waking dream.  Methought I sate beside a public way  Thick strewn with summer dust, & a great stream  Of people there was hurrying to & fro  Numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam,  All hastening onward, yet none seemed to know  Whither he went, or whence he came, or why  He made one of the multitude, yet so  Was borne amid the crowd as through the sky  One of the million leaves of summer's bier.--  Old age & youth, manhood & infancy,  Mixed in one mighty torrent did appear,  Some flying from the thing they feared & some  Seeking the object of another's fear,  And others as with steps towards the tomb  Pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath,  And others mournfully within the gloom  Of their own shadow walked, and called it death ...    And some fled from it as it were a ghost,  Half fainting in the affliction of vain breath.  But more with motions which each other crost  Pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw  Or birds within the noonday ether lost,  Upon that path where flowers never grew;  And weary with vain toil & faint for thirst  Heard not the fountains whose melodious dew  Out of their mossy cells forever burst  Nor felt the breeze which from the forest told  Of grassy paths, & wood lawns interspersed  With overarching elms & caverns cold,  And violet banks where sweet dreams brood, but they  Pursued their serious folly as of old ....  And as I gazed methought that in the way  The throng grew wilder, as the woods of June  When the South wind shakes the extinguished day.--  And a cold glare, intenser than the noon  But icy cold, obscured with [[blank]] light  The Sun as he the stars. Like the young moon  When on the sunlit limits of the night  Her white shell trembles amid crimson air  And whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might  Doth, as a herald of its coming, bear  The ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim form  Bends in dark ether from her infant's chair,  So came a chariot on the silent storm  Of its own rushing splendour, and a Shape  So sate within as one whom years deform  Beneath a dusky hood & double cape  Crouching within the shadow of a tomb,  And o'er what seemed the head, a cloud like crape,  Was bent a dun & faint etherial gloom  Tempering the light; upon the chariot's beam  A Janus-visaged Shadow did assume  The guidance of that wonder-winged team.  The Shapes which drew it in thick lightnings  Were lost: I heard alone on the air's soft stream  The music of their ever moving wings.  All the four faces of that charioteer  Had their eyes banded . . . little profit brings  Speed in the van & blindness in the rear,  Nor then avail the beams that quench the Sun  Or that his banded eyes could pierce the sphere  Of all that is, has been, or will be done.--  So ill was the car guided, but it past  With solemn speed majestically on . . .  The crowd gave way, & I arose aghast,  Or seemed to rise, so mighty was the trance,  And saw like clouds upon the thunder blast  The million with fierce song and maniac dance  Raging around; such seemed the jubilee  As when to greet some conqueror's advance  Imperial Rome poured forth her living sea  From senatehouse & prison & theatre  When Freedom left those who upon the free  Had bound a yoke which soon they stooped to bear.  Nor wanted here the true similitude  Of a triumphal pageant, for where'er  The chariot rolled a captive multitude  Was driven; althose who had grown old in power  Or misery,--all who have their age subdued,  By action or by suffering, and whose hour  Was drained to its last sand in weal or woe,  So that the trunk survived both fruit & flower;  All those whose fame or infamy must grow  Till the great winter lay the form & name  Of their own earth with them forever low,  All but the sacred few who could not tame  Their spirits to the Conqueror, but as soon  As they had touched the world with living flame  Fled back like eagles to their native noon,  Of those who put aside the diadem  Of earthly thrones or gems, till the last one  Were there;--for they of Athens & Jerusalem  Were neither mid the mighty captives seen  Nor mid the ribald crowd that followed them  Or fled before . . Now swift, fierce & obscene  The wild dance maddens in the van, & those  Who lead it, fleet as shadows on the green,  Outspeed the chariot & without repose  Mix with each other in tempestuous measure  To savage music .... Wilder as it grows,  They, tortured by the agonizing pleasure,  Convulsed & on the rapid whirlwinds spun  Of that fierce spirit, whose unholy leisure  Was soothed by mischief since the world begun,  Throw back their heads & loose their streaming hair,  And in their dance round her who dims the Sun  Maidens & youths fling their wild arms in air  As their feet twinkle; they recede, and now  Bending within each other's atmosphere  Kindle invisibly; and as they glow  Like moths by light attracted & repelled,  Oft to new bright destruction come & go.  Till like two clouds into one vale impelled  That shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle  And die in rain,--the fiery band which held  Their natures, snaps . . . ere the shock cease to tingle  One falls and then another in the path  Senseless, nor is the desolation single,  Yet ere I can say  where the chariot hath  Past over them; nor other trace I find  But as of foam after the Ocean's wrath  Is spent upon the desert shore.--Behind,  Old men, and women foully disarrayed  Shake their grey hair in the insulting wind,  Limp in the dance & strain, with limbs decayed,  Seeking to reach the light which leaves them still  Farther behind & deeper in the shade.  But not the less with impotence of will  They wheel, though ghastly shadows interpose  Round them & round each other, and fulfill  Their work and to the dust whence they arose  Sink & corruption veils them as they lie  And frost in these performs what fire in those.  Struck to the heart by this sad pageantry,  Half to myself I said, ""And what is this?  Whose shape is that within the car? & why""-  I would have added--""is all here amiss?""  But a voice answered . . ""Life"" . . . I turned & knew  (O Heaven have mercy on such wretchedness!)  That what I thought was an old root which grew  To strange distortion out of the hill side  Was indeed one of that deluded crew,  And that the grass which methought hung so wide  And white, was but his thin discoloured hair,  And that the holes it vainly sought to hide  Were or had been eyes.--""lf thou canst forbear  To join the dance, which I had well forborne,""  Said the grim Feature, of my thought aware,  ""I will now tell that which to this deep scorn  Led me & my companions, and relate  The progress of the pageant since the morn;  ""If thirst of knowledge doth not thus abate,  Follow it even to the night, but I  Am weary"" . . . Then like one who with the weight  Of his own words is staggered, wearily  He paused, and ere he could resume, I cried,  ""First who art thou?"" . . . ""Before thy memory  ""I feared, loved, hated, suffered, did, & died,  And if the spark with which Heaven lit my spirit  Earth had with purer nutriment supplied  ""Corruption would not now thus much inherit  Of what was once Rousseau--nor this disguise  Stained that within which still disdains to wear it.--  ""If I have been extinguished, yet there rise  A thousand beacons from the spark I bore.""--  ""And who are those chained to the car?"" ""The Wise,  ""The great, the unforgotten: they who wore  Mitres & helms & crowns, or wreathes of light,  Signs of thought's empire over thought; their lore  ""Taught them not this--to know themselves; their might  Could not repress the mutiny within,  And for the morn of truth they feigned, deep night  ""Caught them ere evening."" ""Who is he with chin  Upon his breast and hands crost on his chain?""  ""The Child of a fierce hour; he sought to win  ""The world, and lost all it did contain  Of greatness, in its hope destroyed; & more  Of fame & peace than Virtue's self can gain  ""Without the opportunity which bore  Him on its eagle's pinion to the peak  From which a thousand climbers have before  ""Fall'n as Napoleon fell.""--I felt my cheek  Alter to see the great form pass away  Whose grasp had left the giant world so weak  That every pigmy kicked it as it lay--  And much I grieved to think how power & will  In opposition rule our mortal day--  And why God made irreconcilable  Good & the means of good; and for despair  I half disdained mine eye's desire to fill  With the spent vision of the times that were  And scarce have ceased to be . . .

How did thy course begin,"" I said, ""& why?

Remorse,"                        AWAY! the moor is dark beneath the moon,    Rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even: Away! the gathering winds will call the darkness soon,    And profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven. Pause not! the time is past! Every voice cries, 'Away!'    Tempt not with one last tear thy friend's ungentle mood: Thy lover's eye, so glazed and cold, dares not entreat thy stay:    Duty and dereliction guide thee back to solitude. Away, away! to thy sad and silent home;    Pour bitter tears on its desolated hearth; Watch the dim shades as like ghosts they go and come,    And complicate strange webs of melancholy mirth. The leaves of wasted autumn woods shall float around thine head,    The blooms of dewy Spring shall gleam beneath thy feet: But thy soul or this world must fade in the frost that binds the dead,    Ere midnight's frown and morning's smile, ere thou and peace, may    meet. The cloud shadows of midnight possess their own repose,    For the weary winds are silent, or the moon is in the deep; Some respite to its turbulence unresting ocean knows;    Whatever moves or toils or grieves hath its appointed sleep. Thou in the grave shalt rest:--yet, till the phantoms flee,    Which that house and heath and garden made dear to thee erewhile, Thy remembrance and repentance and deep musings are not free    From the music of two voices, and the light of one sweet smile.

Hymn Of Pan,"                        FROM the forests and highlands                We come, we come;            From the river-girt islands,                Where loud waves are dumb    Listening to my sweet pipings.        The wind in the reeds and the rushes,            The bees on the bells of thyme,        The birds on the myrtle-bushes,            The cicale above in the lime,        And the lizards below in the grass,Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was,    Listening to my sweet pipings.    Liquid Peneus was flowing,        And all dark Temple lay    In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing        The light of the dying day,    Speeded by my sweet pipings.        The Sileni and Sylvans and fauns,            And the Nymphs of the woods and wave        To the edge of the moist river-lawns,            And the brink of the dewy caves,And all that did then attend and follow,Were silent with love,--as you now, Apollo,    With envy of my sweet pipings.    I sang of the dancing stars,        I sang of the dedal earth,    And of heaven, and the Giant wars,        And love, and death, and birth.    And then I changed my pipings,--Singing how down the vale of Maenalus    I pursued a maiden, and clasped a reed:Gods and men, we are all deluded thus;    It breaks in our bosom, and then we bleed.All wept--as I think both ye now would,If envy or age had not frozen your blood--    At the sorrow of my sweet pipings.

To Wordsworth,"                        Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know That things depart which never may return: Childhood and youth, friendship and love's first glow, Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn. These common woes I feel. One loss is mine Which thou too feel'st, yet I alone deplore. Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine On some frail bark in winter's midnight roar: Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood Above the blind and battling multitude: In honoured poverty thy voice did weave Songs consecrate to truth and liberty,-- Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve, Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be.

Lines: The Cold Earth Slept Below,"                            The cold earth slept below;         Above the cold sky shone;          And all around,          With a chilling sound,    From caves of ice and fields of snow    The breath of night like death did flow          Beneath the sinking moon.    The wintry hedge was black;        The green grass was not seen;          The birds did rest          On the bare thorn's breast,  Whose roots, beside the pathway track,  Had bound their folds o'er many a crack          Which the frost had made between.  Thine eyes glow'd in the glare      Of the moon's dying light;          As a fen-fire's beam          On a sluggish stream  Gleams dimly--so the moon shone there,  And it yellow'd the strings of thy tangled hair,          That shook in the wind of night.  The moon made thy lips pale, belov{`e}d;      The wind made thy bosom chill;          The night did shed          On thy dear head  Its frozen dew, and thou didst lie  Where the bitter breath of the naked sky          Might visit thee at will.

The Invitation,"                        BEST and brightest, come away! Fairer far than this fair Day, Which, like thee to those in sorrow, Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow To the rough Year just awake In its cradle on the brake. The brightest hour of unborn Spring, Through the winter wandering, Found, it seems, the halcyon Morn To hoar February born. Bending from heaven, in azure mirth, It kiss'd the forehead of the Earth; And smiled upon the silent sea; And bade the frozen streams be free; And waked to music all their fountains; And breathed upon the frozen mountains; And like a prophetess of May Strew'd flowers upon the barren way, Making the wintry world appear Like one on whom thou smilest, dear. Away, away, from men and towns, To the wild wood and the downs-- To the silent wilderness Where the soul need not repress Its music lest it should not find An echo in another's mind, While the touch of Nature's art Harmonizes heart to heart. I leave this notice on my door For each accustom'd visitor:-- 'I am gone into the fields To take what this sweet hour yields. Reflection, you may come to-morrow; Sit by the fireside with Sorrow. You with the unpaid bill, Despair,-- You, tiresome verse-reciter, Care,-- I will pay you in the grave,-- Death will listen to your stave. Expectation too, be off! To-day is for itself enough. Hope, in pity mock not Woe With smiles, nor follow where I go; Long having lived on your sweet food, At length I find one moment's good After long pain: with all your love, This you never told me of.' Radiant Sister of the Day, Awake! arise! and come away! To the wild woods and the plains; And the pools where winter rains Image all their roof of leaves; Where the pine its garland weaves Of sapless green and ivy dun Round stems that never kiss the sun; Where the lawns and pastures be, And the sandhills of the sea; Where the melting hoar-frost wets The daisy-star that never sets, And wind-flowers, and violets Which yet join not scent to hue, Crown the pale year weak and new; When the night is left behind In the deep east, dun and blind, And the blue noon is over us, And the multitudinous Billows murmur at our feet Where the earth and ocean meet, And all things seem only one In the universal sun.

Feelings Of A Republican On The Fall Of Bonaparte,"                        I hated thee, fallen tyrant! I did groan To think that a most unambitious slave, Like thou, shouldst dance and revel on the grave Of Liberty. Thou mightst have built thy throne Where it had stood even now: thou didst prefer A frail and bloody pomp which Time has swept In fragments towards Oblivion. Massacre, For this I prayed, would on thy sleep have crept, Treason and Slavery, Rapine, Fear, and Lust, And stifled thee, their minister. I know Too late, since thou and France are in the dust, That Virtue owns a more eternal foe Than Force or Fraud: old Custom, legal Crime, And bloody Faith the foulest birth of Time.

Hymn To Intellectual Beauty,"                        The awful shadow of some unseen PowerFloats through unseen among us, -- visitingThis various world with as inconstant wingAs summer winds that creep from flower to flower, --Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower,It visits with inconstant glanceEach human heart and countenance;Like hues and harmonies of evening, --Like clouds in starlight widely spread, --Like memory of music fled, --Like aught that for its grace may beDear, and yet dearer for its mystery.Spirit of Beauty, that dost consecrateWith thine own hues all thou dost shine uponOf human thought or form, -- where art thou gone?Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?Ask why the sunlight not for everWeaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river,Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown,Why fear and dream and death and birthCast on the daylight of this earthSuch gloom, -- why man has such a scopeFor love and hate, despondency and hope?No voice from some sublimer world hath everTo sage or poet these responses given --Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven,Remain the records of their vain endeavour,Frail spells -- whose uttered charm might not avail to sever,From all we hear and all we see,Doubt, chance, and mutability.Thy light alone -- like mist oe'er the mountains driven,Or music by the night-wind sentThrough strings of some still instrument,Or moonlight on a midnight stream,Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream.Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds departAnd come, for some uncertain moments lent.Man were immortal, and omnipotent,Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art,Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart.Thou messgenger of sympathies,That wax and wane in lovers' eyes --Thou -- that to human thought art nourishment,Like darkness to a dying flame!Depart not as thy shadow came,Depart not -- lest the grave should be,Like life and fear, a dark reality.While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and spedThrough many a listening chamber, cave and ruin,And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuingHopes of high talk with the departed dead.I called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed;I was not heard -- I saw them not --When musing deeply on the lotOf life, at that sweet time when winds are wooingAll vital things that wake to bringNews of birds and blossoming, --Sudden, thy shadow fell on me;I shrieked, and clasped my hands in ecstasy!I vowed that I would dedicate my powersTo thee and thine -- have I not kept the vow?With beating heart and streaming eyes, even nowI call the phantoms of a thousand hoursEach from his voiceless grave: they have in visioned bowersOf studious zeal or love's delightOutwatched with me the envious night --They know that never joy illumed my browUnlinked with hope that thou wouldst freeThis world from its dark slavery,That thou - O awful Loveliness,Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express.The day becomes more solemn and sereneWhen noon is past -- there is a harmonyIn autumn, and a lustre in its sky,Which through the summer is not heard or seen,As if it could not be, as if it had not been!Thus let thy power, which like the truthOf nature on my passive youthDescended, to my onward life supplyIts calm -- to one who worships thee,And every form containing thee,Whom, Spirit fair, thy spells did bindTo fear himself, and love all human kind.

The Mask Of Anarchy,"                        I.As I lay asleep in ItalyThere came a voice from over the Sea,And with great power it forth led meTo walk in the visions of Poesy.II.I met Murder on the way-He had a mask like Castlereagh-Very smooth he looked, yet grim;Seven blood-hounds followed him:III.All were fat; and well they mightBe in admirable plight,For one by one, and two by two,He tossed them human hearts to chewWhich from his wide cloak he drew.IV.Next came Fraud, and he had on,Like Eldon, an ermined gown;His big tears, for he wept well,Turned to mill-stones as they fell.V.And the little children, whoRound his feet played to and fro,Thinking every tear a gem,Had their brains knocked out by them.VI.Clothed with the Bible, as with light,And the shadows of the night,Like Sidmouth, next, HypocrisyOn a crocodile rode by.VII.And many more Destructions playedIn this ghastly masquerade,All disguised, even to the eyes,Like Bishops, lawyers, peers, or spies.VIII.Last came Anarchy: he rodeOn a white horse, splashed with blood;He was pale even to the lips,Like Death in the Apocalypse.IX.And he wore a kingly crown;And in his grasp a sceptre shone;On his brow this mark I saw-'I am God, and King, and Law!'X.With a pace stately and fast,Over English land he passed,Trampling to a mire of bloodThe adoring multitude.XI.And a mighty troop around,With their trampling shook the ground,Waving each a bloody sword,For the service of their Lord.XII.And with glorious triumph, theyRode through England proud and gay,Drunk as with intoxicationOf the wine of desolation.XIII.O'er fields and towns, from sea to sea,Passed the Pageant swift and free,Tearing up, and trampling down;Till they came to London town.XIV.And each dweller, panic-stricken,Felt his heart with terror sickenHearing the tempestuous cryOf the triumph of Anarchy.XV.For with pomp to meet him came,Clothed in arms like blood and flame,The hired murderers, who did sing'Thou art God, and Law, and King.XVI.'We have waited, weak and loneFor thy coming, Mighty One!Our purses are empty, our swords are cold,Give us glory, and blood, and gold.'XVII.Lawyers and priests, a motley crowd,To the earth their pale brows bowed;Like a bad prayer not over loud,Whispering-'Thou art Law and God.'-XVIII.Then all cried with one accord,'Thou art King, and God, and Lord;Anarchy, to thee we bow,Be thy name made holy now!'XIX.And Anarchy, the Skeleton,Bowed and grinned to every one,As well as if his educationHad cost ten millions to the nation.XX.For he knew the PalacesOf our Kings were rightly his;His the sceptre, crown, and globe,And the gold-inwoven robe.XXI.So he sent his slaves beforeTo seize upon the Bank and Tower,And was proceeding with intentTo meet his pensioned ParliamentXXII.When one fled past, a maniac maid,And her name was Hope, she said:But she looked more like Despair,And she cried out in the air:XXIII.'My father Time is weak and grayWith waiting for a better day;See how idiot-like he stands,Fumbling with his palsied hands!XXIV.'He has had child after child,And the dust of death is piledOver every one but me-Misery, oh, Misery!'XXV.Then she lay down in the street,Right before the horses' feet,Expecting, with a patient eye,Murder, Fraud, and Anarchy.XXVI.When between her and her foesA mist, a light, an image rose,Small at first, and weak, and frailLike the vapour of a vale:XXVII.Till as clouds grow on the blast,Like tower-crowned giants striding fast,And glare with lightnings as they fly,And speak in thunder to the sky,XXVIII.It grew-a Shape arrayed in mailBrighter than the viper's scale,And upborne on wings whose grainWas as the light of sunny rain.XXIX.On its helm, seen far away,A planet, like the Morning's, lay;And those plumes its light rained throughLike a shower of crimson dew.XXX.With step as soft as wind it passedO'er the heads of men-so fastThat they knew the presence there,And looked,-but all was empty air.XXXI.As flowers beneath May's footstep waken,As stars from Night's loose hair are shaken,As waves arise when loud winds call,Thoughts sprung where'er that step did fall.XXXII.And the prostrate multitudeLooked-and ankle-deep in blood,Hope, that maiden most serene,Was walking with a quiet mien:XXXIII.And Anarchy, the ghastly birth,Lay dead earth upon the earth;The Horse of Death tameless as windFled, and with his hoofs did grindTo dust the murderers thronged behind.XXXIV.A rushing light of clouds and splendour,A sense awakening and yet tenderWas heard and felt-and at its closeThese words of joy and fear aroseXXXV.As if their own indignant EarthWhich gave the sons of England birthHad felt their blood upon her brow,And shuddering with a mother's throeXXXVI.Had turnèd every drop of bloodBy which her face had been bedewedTo an accent unwithstood,-As if her heart had cried aloud:XXXVII.'Men of England, heirs of Glory,Heroes of unwritten story,Nurslings of one mighty Mother,Hopes of her, and one

Prometheus Unbound: Act I (Excerpt),"                        SCENE.--A Ravine of Icy Rocks in the Indian Caucasus. Prometheus is discovered bound to the Precipice. Panthea and Ione areseated at his feet. Time, night. During the Scene, morning slowly breaks.Prometheus.      Monarch of Gods and Dæmons, and all Spirits    But One, who throng those bright and rolling worlds    Which Thou and I alone of living things    Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth    Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou    Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and praise,    And toil, and hecatombs of broken hearts,    With fear and self-contempt and barren hope.    Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate,   Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy scorn,   O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge.   Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours,   And moments aye divided by keen pangs   Till they seemed years, torture and solitude,   Scorn and despair,--these are mine empire:--   More glorious far than that which thou surveyest   From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God!   Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame   Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here   Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain,   Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb,   Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life.   Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!    No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure.   I ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt?   I ask yon Heaven, the all-beholding Sun,   Has it not seen? The Sea, in storm or calm,   Heaven's ever-changing Shadow, spread below,   Have its deaf waves not heard my agony?   Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!    The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears   Of their moon-freezing crystals, the bright chains   Eat with their burning cold into my bones.   Heaven's wingèd hound, polluting from thy lips   His beak in poison not his own, tears up   My heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by,   The ghastly people of the realm of dream,   Mocking me: and the Earthquake-fiends are charged   To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds   When the rocks split and close again behind:   While from their loud abysses howling throng   The genii of the storm, urging the rage   Of whirlwind, and afflict me with keen hail.   And yet to me welcome is day and night,   Whether one breaks the hoar frost of the morn,   Or starry, dim, and slow, the other climbs   The leaden-coloured east; for then they lead   The wingless, crawling hours, one among whom   --As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim--   Shall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the blood   From these pale feet, which then might trample thee   If they disdained not such a prostrate slave.   Disdain! Ah no! I pity thee. What ruin   Will hunt thee undefended through wide Heaven!   How will thy soul, cloven to its depth with terror,   Gape like a hell within! I speak in grief,   Not exultation, for I hate no more,   As then ere misery made me wise. The curse   Once breathed on thee I would recall. Ye Mountains,   Whose many-voicèd Echoes, through the mist   Of cataracts, flung the thunder of that spell!   Ye icy Springs, stagnant with wrinkling frost,   Which vibrated to hear me, and then crept   Shuddering through India! Thou serenest Air,   Through which the Sun walks burning without beams!   And ye swift Whirlwinds, who on poisèd wings   Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss,   As thunder, louder than your own, made rock   The orbèd world! If then my words had power,   Though I am changed so that aught evil wish   Is dead within; although no memory be   Of what is hate, let them not lose it now!   What was that curse? for ye all heard me speak....                                             "

To Night,"                        Swiftly walk o'er the western wave,       Spirit of Night!Out of the misty eastern cave,Where, all the long and lone daylight,Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,Which make thee terrible and dear--       Swift be thy flight!Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,       Star-inwrought!Blind with thine hair the eyes of day;Kiss her until she be wearied out,Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land,Touching all with thine opiate wand--       Come, long-sought!When I arose and saw the dawn,       I sighed for thee;When light rode high, and the dew was gone,And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,And the weary day turned to his rest,Lingering like an unloved guest,       I sighed for thee.Thy brother Death came, and cried,       Wouldst thou me?Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,Murmured like a noontide bee,Shall I nestle near thy side?Wouldst thou me?--And I replied,       No, not thee!Death will come when thou art dead,       Soon, too soon--Sleep will come when thou art fled;Of neither would I ask the boonI ask of thee, beloved Night--Swift be thine approaching flight,       Come soon, soon!

Art Thou Pale For Weariness,"                        Art thou pale for weariness Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,Wandering companionlessAmong the stars that have a different birth,And ever changing, like a joyless eyeThat finds no object worth its constancy?

An Exhortation,"                        Chameleons feed on light and air: Poets' food is love and fame: If in this wide world of care Poets could but find the same With as little toil as they, Would they ever change their hue As the light chameleons do, Suiting it to every ray Twenty times a day? Poets are on this cold earth, As chameleons might be, Hidden from their early birth In a cave beneath the sea; Where light is, chameleons change: Where love is not, poets do: Fame is love disguised: if few Find either, never think it strange That poets range. Yet dare not stain with wealth or power A poet's free and heavenly mind: If bright chameleons should devour Any food but beams and wind, They would grow as earthly soon As their brother lizards are. Children of a sunnier star, Spirits from beyond the moon, O, refuse the boon!                                             "
England In 1819,"                        An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king,-- Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow Through public scorn,--mud from a muddy spring,-- Rulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know, But leech-like to their fainting country cling, Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow,-- A people starved and stabbed in the untilled field,-- An army, which liberticide and prey Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield,-- Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay; Religion Christless, Godless--a book sealed; A Senate,--Time's worst statute unrepealed,-- Are graves, from which a glorious Phantom may Burst, to illumine our tempestous day.

"A Summer Evening Churchyard, Lechlade, Gloucestershire","                        THE wind has swept from the wide atmosphere          Each vapour that obscured the sunset's ray,     And pallid Evening twines its beaming hairIn duskier braids around the languid eyes of Day:     Silence and Twilight, unbeloved of men,     Creep hand in hand from yon obscurest glen.     They breathe their spells towards the departing day,          Encompassing the earth, air, stars, and sea;     Light, sound, and motion, own the potent sway,Responding to the charm with its own mystery.     The winds are still, or the dry church-tower grass     Knows not their gentle motions as they pass.     Thou too, aerial pile, whose pinnacles          Point from one shrine like pyramids of fire,     Obey'st I in silence their sweet solemn spells,Clothing in hues of heaven thy dim and distant spire,     Around whose lessening and invisible height     Gather among the stars the clouds of night.     The dead are sleeping in their sepulchres:          And, mouldering as they sleep, a thrilling sound,     Half sense half thought, among the darkness stirs,Breathed from their wormy beds all living things around,     And, mingling with the still night and mute sky,     Its awful hush is felt inaudibly.     Thus solemnized and softened, death is mild          And terrorless as this serenest night.     Here could I hope, like some enquiring childSporting on graves, that death did hide from human sight     Sweet secrets, or beside its breathless sleep     That loveliest dreams perpetual watch did keep.

I have made my bedIn charnels and on coffins, where black deathKeeps record of the trophies won from thee,Hoping to still these obstinate questioningsOf thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost,Thy messenger, to render up the taleOf what we are. In lone and silent hours,When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness, Like an inspired and desperate alchemistStaking his very life on some dark hope,Have I mixed awful talk and asking looksWith my most innocent love, until strange tears,Uniting with those breathless kisses, madeSuch magic as compels the charmèd nightTo render up thy charge; and, though ne'er yetThou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary,Enough from incommunicable dream,And twilight phantasms, and deep noonday thought, Has shone within me, that serenely nowAnd moveless, as a long-forgotten lyreSuspended in the solitary domeOf some mysterious and deserted fane,I wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strainMay modulate with murmurs of the air,And motions of the forests and the sea,And voice of living beings, and woven hymnsOf night and day, and the deep heart of man.There was a Poet whose untimely tomb No human hands with pious reverence reared,But the charmed eddies of autumnal windsBuilt o'er his mouldering bones a pyramidOf mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:A lovely youth,--no mourning maiden deckedWith weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath,The lone couch of his everlasting sleep:Gentle, and brave, and generous,--no lorn bardBreathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh:He lived, he died, he sung in solitude. Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes,And virgins, as unknown he passed, have pinedAnd wasted for fond love of his wild eyes.The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn,And Silence, too enamoured of that voice,Locks its mute music in her rugged cell.By solemn vision and bright silver dreamHis infancy was nurtured. Every sightAnd sound from the vast earth and ambient airSent to his heart its choicest impulses. The fountains of divine philosophyFled not his thirsting lips, and all of great,Or good, or lovely, which the sacred pastIn truth or fable consecrates, he feltAnd knew. When early youth had passed, he leftHis cold fireside and alienated homeTo seek strange truths in undiscovered lands.Many a wide waste and tangled wildernessHas lured his fearless steps; and he has boughtWith his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men, His rest and food. Nature's most secret stepsHe like her shadow has pursued, where'erThe red volcano overcanopiesIts fields of snow and pinnacles of iceWith burning smoke, or where bitumen lakesOn black bare pointed islets ever beatWith sluggish surge, or where the secret caves,Rugged and dark, winding among the springsOf fire and poison, inaccessibleTo avarice or pride, their starry domes Of diamond and of gold expand aboveNumberless and immeasurable halls,Frequent with crystal column, and clear shrinesOf pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite.Nor had that scene of ampler majestyThan gems or gold, the varying roof of heavenAnd the green earth, lost in his heart its claimsTo love and wonder; he would linger longIn lonesome vales, making the wild his home,Until the doves and squirrels would partake From his innocuous band his bloodless food,Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks,And the wild antelope, that starts whene'erThe dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspendHer timid steps, to gaze upon a formMore graceful than her own.His wandering step,Obedient to high thoughts, has visitedThe awful ruins of the days of old:Athens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the wasteWhere stood Jerusalem, the fallen towersOf Babylon, the eternal pyramids,Memphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange,Sculptured on alabaster obeliskOr jasper tomb or mutilated sphinx,Dark Æthiopia in her desert hillsConceals. Among the ruined temples there,Stupendous columns, and wild imagesOf more than man, where marble daemons watchThe Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead menHang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around, He lingered, poring on memorialsOf the world's youth: through the long burning dayGazed on those speechless shapes; nor, when the moonFilled the mysterious halls with floating shadesSuspended he that task, but ever gazedAnd gazed, till meaning on his vacant mindFlashed like strong inspiration, and he sawThe thrilling secrets of the birth of time.Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food,Her daily portion, from her father's tent, And spread her matting for his couch, and stoleFrom duties and repose to tend his steps,Enamoured, yet not daring for deep aweTo speak her love, and watched his nightly sleep,Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lipsParted in slumber, whence the regular breathOf innocent dreams arose; then, when red mornMade paler the pale moon, to her cold homeWildered, and wan, and panting, she returned.The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie, And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,And o'er the aërial mountains which pour downIndus and Oxus from their icy caves,In joy and exultation held his way;Till in the vale of Cashmire, far withinIts loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwineBeneath the hollow rocks a natural bower,Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretchedHis languid limbs. A vision on his sleepThere came, a dream of hopes that never yet Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veilèd maidSate near him, talking in low solemn tones.Her voice was like the voice of his own soulHeard in the calm of thought; its music long,Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, heldHis inmost sense suspended in its webOf many-colored woof and shifting hues.Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme,And lofty hopes of divine liberty,Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy, Herself a poet. Soon the solemn moodOf her pure mind kindled through all her frameA permeating fire; wild numbers thenShe raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobsSubdued by its own pathos; her fair handsWere bare alone, sweeping from some strange harpStrange symphony, and in their branching veinsThe eloquent blood told an ineffable tale.The beating of her heart was heard to fillThe pauses of her music, and her breath Tumultuously accorded with those fitsOf intermitted song. Sudden she rose,As if her heart impatiently enduredIts bursting burden; at the sound he turned,And saw by the warm light of their own lifeHer glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veilOf woven wind, her outspread arms now bare,Her dark locks floating in the breath of night,Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lipsOutstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly. His strong heart sunk and sickened with excessOf love. He reared his shuddering limbs, and quelledHis gasping breath, and spread his arms to meetHer panting bosom:--she drew back awhile,Then, yielding to the irresistible joy,With frantic gesture and short breathless cryFolded his frame in her dissolving arms.Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and nightInvolved and swallowed up the vision; sleep,Like a dark flood suspended in its course, Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain.Roused by the shock, he started from his trance--The cold white light of morning, the blue moonLow in the west, the clear and garish hills,The distinct valley and the vacant woods,Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fledThe hues of heaven that canopied his bowerOf yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep,The mystery and the majesty of Earth,The joy, the exultation? His wan eyes Gaze on the empty scene as vacantlyAs ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven.The spirit of sweet human love has sentA vision to the sleep of him who spurnedHer choicest gifts. He eagerly pursuesBeyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade;He overleaps the bounds. Alas! alas!Were limbs and breath and being intertwinedThus treacherously? Lost, lost, forever lostIn the wide pathless desert of dim sleep, That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of deathConduct to thy mysterious paradise,O Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow cloudsAnd pendent mountains seen in the calm lakeLead only to a black and watery depth,While death's blue vault with loathliest vapors hung,Where every shade which the foul grave exhalesHides its dead eye from the detested day,Conducts, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms?This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart; The insatiate hope which it awakened stungHis brain even like despair.While daylight heldThe sky, the Poet kept mute conferenceWith his still soul. At night the passion came,Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream,And shook him from his rest, and led him forthInto the darkness. As an eagle, graspedIn folds of the green serpent, feels her breastBurn with the poison, and precipitatesThrough night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud, Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flightO'er the wide aëry wilderness: thus drivenBy the bright shadow of that lovely dream,Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night,Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells,Startling with careless step the moon-light snake,He fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight,Shedding the mockery of its vital huesUpon his cheek of death. He wandered onTill vast Aornos seen from Petra's steep Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud;Through Balk, and where the desolated tombsOf Parthian kings scatter to every windTheir wasting dust, wildly he wandered on,Day after day, a weary waste of hours,Bearing within his life the brooding careThat ever fed on its decaying flame.And now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair,Sered by the autumn of strange suffering,Sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand Hung like dead bone within its withered skin;Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone,As in a furnace burning secretly,From his dark eyes alone. The cottagers,Who ministered with human charityHis human wants, beheld with wondering aweTheir fleeting visitant. The mountaineer,Encountering on some dizzy precipiceThat spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of Wind,With lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet Disturbing not the drifted snow, had pausedIn its career; the infant would concealHis troubled visage in his mother's robeIn terror at the glare of those wild eyes,To remember their strange light in many a dreamOf after times; but youthful maidens, taughtBy nature, would interpret half the woeThat wasted him, would call him with false namesBrother and friend, would press his pallid handAt parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path Of his departure from their father's door.At length upon the lone Chorasmian shoreHe paused, a wide and melancholy wasteOf putrid marshes. A strong impulse urgedHis steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there,Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds.It rose as he approached, and, with strong wingsScaling the upward sky, bent its bright courseHigh over the immeasurable main.His eyes pursued its flight:--'Thou hast a home, Beautiful bird! thou voyagest to thine home,Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neckWith thine, and welcome thy return with eyesBright in the lustre of their own fond joy.And what am I that I should linger here,With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes,Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attunedTo beauty, wasting these surpassing powersIn the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heavenThat echoes not my thoughts?' A gloomy smile Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips.For sleep, he knew, kept most relentlesslyIts precious charge, and silent death exposed,Faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure,With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms.Startled by his own thoughts, he looked around.There was no fair fiend near him, not a sightOr sound of awe but in his own deep mind.A little shallop floating near the shoreCaught the impatient wandering of his gaze. It had been long abandoned, for its sidesGaped wide with many a rift, and its frail jointsSwayed with the undulations of the tide.A restless impulse urged him to embarkAnd meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste;For well he knew that mighty Shadow lovesThe slimy caverns of the populous deep.The day was fair and sunny; sea and skyDrank its inspiring radiance, and the windSwept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves. Following his eager soul, the wandererLeaped in the boat; he spread his cloak aloftOn the bare mast, and took his lonely seat,And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil seaLike a torn cloud before the hurricane.As one that in a silver vision floatsObedient to the sweep of odorous windsUpon resplendent clouds, so rapidlyAlong the dark and ruffled waters fledThe straining boat. A whirlwind swept it on, With fierce gusts and precipitating force,Through the white ridges of the chafèd sea.The waves arose. Higher and higher stillTheir fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourgeLike serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp.Calm and rejoicing in the fearful warOf wave ruining on wave, and blast on blastDescending, and black flood on whirlpool drivenWith dark obliterating course, he sate:As if their genii were the ministers Appointed to conduct him to the lightOf those belovèd eyes, the Poet sate,Holding the steady helm. Evening came on;The beams of sunset hung their rainbow huesHigh 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted sprayThat canopied his path o'er the waste deep;Twilight, ascending slowly from the east,Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locksO'er the fair front and radiant eyes of Day;Night followed, clad with stars. On every side More horribly the multitudinous streamsOf ocean's mountainous waste to mutual warRushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mockThe calm and spangled sky. The little boatStill fled before the storm; still fled, like foamDown the steep cataract of a wintry river;Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave;Now leaving far behind the bursting massThat fell, convulsing ocean; safely fled--As if that frail and wasted human form Had been an elemental god.At midnightThe moon arose; and lo! the ethereal cliffsOf Caucasus, whose icy summits shoneAmong the stars like sunlight, and aroundWhose caverned base the whirlpools and the wavesBursting and eddying irresistiblyRage and resound forever.--Who shall save?--The boat fled on,--the boiling torrent drove,--The crags closed round with black and jagged arms,The shattered mountain overhung the sea, And faster still, beyond all human speed,Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave,The little boat was driven. A cavern thereYawned, and amid its slant and winding depthsIngulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled onWith unrelaxing speed.--'Vision and Love!'The Poet cried aloud, 'I have beheldThe path of thy departure. Sleep and deathShall not divide us long.'The boat pursuedThe windings of the cavern. Daylight shone At length upon that gloomy river's flow;Now, where the fiercest war among the wavesIs calm, on the unfathomable streamThe boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven,Exposed those black depths to the azure sky,Ere yet the flood's enormous volume fellEven to the base of Caucasus, with soundThat shook the everlasting rocks, the massFilled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm;Stair above stair the eddying waters rose, Circling immeasurably fast, and lavedWith alternating dash the gnarlèd rootsOf mighty trees, that stretched their giant armsIn darkness over it. I' the midst was left,Reflecting yet distorting every cloud,A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm.Seized by the sway of the ascending stream,With dizzy swiftness, round and round and round,Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose,Till on the verge of the extremest curve, Where through an opening of the rocky bankThe waters overflow, and a smooth spotOf glassy quiet 'mid those battling tidesIs left, the boat paused shuddering.--Shall it sinkDown the abyss? Shall the reverting stressOf that resistless gulf embosom it?Now shall it fall?--A wandering stream of windBreathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail,And, lo! with gentle motion between banksOf mossy slope, and on a placid stream, Beneath a woven grove, it sails, and, hark!The ghastly torrent mingles its far roarWith the breeze murmuring in the musical woods.Where the embowering trees recede, and leaveA little space of green expanse, the coveIs closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowersForever gaze on their own drooping eyes,Reflected in the crystal calm. The waveOf the boat's motion marred their pensive task,Which naught but vagrant bird, or wanton wind, Or falling spear-grass, or their own decayHad e'er disturbed before. The Poet longedTo deck with their bright hues his withered hair,But on his heart its solitude returned,And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hidIn those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame,Had yet performed its ministry; it hungUpon his life, as lightning in a cloudGleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floodsOf night close over it.The noonday sun Now shone upon the forest, one vast massOf mingling shade, whose brown magnificenceA narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves,Scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks,Mocking its moans, respond and roar forever.The meeting boughs and implicated leavesWove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as, ledBy love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death,He sought in Nature's dearest haunt some bank,Her cradle and his sepulchre. More dark And dark the shades accumulate. The oak,Expanding its immense and knotty arms,Embraces the light beech. The pyramidsOf the tall cedar overarching frameMost solemn domes within, and far below,Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky,The ash and the acacia floating hangTremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothedIn rainbow and in fire, the parasites,Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around The gray trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love,These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs,Uniting their close union; the woven leavesMake network of the dark blue light of dayAnd the night's noontide clearness, mutableAs shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawnsBeneath these canopies extend their swells,Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glenSends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmineA soul-dissolving odor to inviteTo some more lovely mystery. Through the dellSilence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keepTheir noonday watch, and sail among the shades,Like vaporous shapes half-seen; beyond, a well,Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave,Images all the woven boughs above,And each depending leaf, and every speck Of azure sky darting between their chasms;Nor aught else in the liquid mirror lavesIts portraiture, but some inconstant star,Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair,Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon,Or gorgeous insect floating motionless,Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wingsHave spread their glories to the gaze of noon.Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheldTheir own wan light through the reflected lines Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depthOf that still fountain; as the human heart,Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heardThe motion of the leaves--the grass that sprungStartled and glanced and trembled even to feelAn unaccustomed presence--and the soundOf the sweet brook that from the secret springsOf that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemedTo stand beside him--clothed in no bright robes Of shadowy silver or enshrining light,Borrowed from aught the visible world affordsOf grace, or majesty, or mystery;But undulating woods, and silent well,And leaping rivulet, and evening gloomNow deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,Held commune with him, as if he and itWere all that was; only--when his regardWas raised by intense pensiveness--two eyes,Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought, And seemed with their serene and azure smilesTo beckon him.Obedient to the lightThat shone within his soul, he went, pursuingThe windings of the dell. The rivulet,Wanton and wild, through many a green ravineBeneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fellAmong the moss with hollow harmonyDark and profound. Now on the polished stonesIt danced, like childhood laughing as it went;Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept, Reflecting every herb and drooping budThat overhung its quietness.--'O stream!Whose source is inaccessibly profound,Whither do thy mysterious waters tend?Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness,Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs,Thy searchless fountain and invisible course,Have each their type in me; and the wide skyAnd measureless ocean may declare as soonWhat oozy cavern or what wandering cloud Contains thy waters, as the universeTell where these living thoughts reside, when stretchedUpon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall wasteI' the passing wind!'Beside the grassy shoreOf the small stream he went; he did impressOn the green moss his tremulous step, that caughtStrong shuddering from his burning limbs. As oneRoused by some joyous madness from the couchOf fever, he did move; yet not like himForgetful of the grave, where, when the flame Of his frail exultation shall be spent,He must descend. With rapid steps he wentBeneath the shade of trees, beside the flowOf the wild babbling rivulet; and nowThe forest's solemn canopies were changedFor the uniform and lightsome evening sky.Gray rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmedThe struggling brook; tall spires of windlestraeThrew their thin shadows down the rugged slope,And nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping rootsThe unwilling soil. A gradual change was hereYet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away,The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thinAnd white, and where irradiate dewy eyesHad shone, gleam stony orbs:--so from his stepsBright flowers departed, and the beautiful shadeOf the green groves, with all their odorous windsAnd musical motions. Calm he still pursuedThe stream, that with a larger volume now Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and thereFretted a path through its descending curvesWith its wintry speed. On every side now roseRocks, which, in unimaginable forms,Lifted their black and barren pinnaclesIn the light of evening, and its precipiceObscuring the ravine, disclosed above,'Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves,Whose windings gave ten thousand various tonguesTo the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks,And seems with its accumulated cragsTo overhang the world; for wide expandBeneath the wan stars and descending moonIslanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams,Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloomOf leaden-colored even, and fiery hillsMingling their flames with twilight, on the vergeOf the remote horizon. The near scene,In naked and severe simplicity, Made contrast with the universe. A pine,Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancyIts swinging boughs, to each inconstant blastYielding one only response at each pauseIn most familiar cadence, with the howl,The thunder and the hiss of homeless streamsMingling its solemn song, whilst the broad riverFoaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path,Fell into that immeasurable void,Scattering its waters to the passing winds. Yet the gray precipice and solemn pineAnd torrent were not all;--one silent nookWas there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain,Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,It overlooked in its serenityThe dark earth and the bending vault of stars.It was a tranquil spot that seemed to smileEven in the lap of horror. Ivy claspedThe fissured stones with its entwining arms,And did embower with leaves forever green And berries dark the smooth and even spaceOf its inviolated floor; and hereThe children of the autumnal whirlwind boreIn wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay,Red, yellow, or ethereally pale,Rivals the pride of summer. 'T is the hauntOf every gentle wind whose breath can teachThe wilds to love tranquillity. One step,One human step alone, has ever brokenThe stillness of its solitude; one voice Alone inspired its echoes;--even that voiceWhich hither came, floating among the winds,And led the loveliest among human formsTo make their wild haunts the depositoryOf all the grace and beauty that enduedIts motions, render up its majesty,Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm,And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould,Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss,Commit the colors of that varying cheek, That snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes.The dim and hornèd moon hung low, and pouredA sea of lustre on the horizon's vergeThat overflowed its mountains. Yellow mistFilled the unbounded atmosphere, and drankWan moonlight even to fulness; not a starShone, not a sound was heard; the very winds,Danger's grim playmates, on that precipiceSlept, clasped in his embrace.--O storm of death,Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night! And thou, colossal Skeleton, that, stillGuiding its irresistible careerIn thy devastating omnipotence,Art king of this frail world! from the red fieldOf slaughter, from the reeking hospital,The patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bedOf innocence, the scaffold and the throne,A mighty voice invokes thee! Ruin callsHis brother Death! A rare and regal preyHe hath prepared, prowling around the world; Glutted with which thou mayst repose, and menGo to their graves like flowers or creeping worms,Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrineThe unheeded tribute of a broken heart.When on the threshold of the green recessThe wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that deathWas on him. Yet a little, ere it fled,Did he resign his high and holy soulTo images of the majestic past,That paused within his passive being now, Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breatheThrough some dim latticed chamber. He did placeHis pale lean hand upon the rugged trunkOf the old pine; upon an ivied stoneReclined his languid head; his limbs did rest,Diffused and motionless, on the smooth brinkOf that obscurest chasm;--and thus he lay,Surrendering to their final impulsesThe hovering powers of life. Hope and Despair,The torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear Marred his repose; the influxes of senseAnd his own being, unalloyed by pain,Yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fedThe stream of thought, till he lay breathing thereAt peace, and faintly smiling. His last sightWas the great moon, which o'er the western lineOf the wide world her mighty horn suspended,With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemedTo mingle. Now upon the jagged hillsIt rests; and still as the divided frame Of the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood,That ever beat in mystic sympathyWith Nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still;And when two lessening points of light aloneGleamed through the darkness, the alternate gaspOf his faint respiration scarce did stirThe stagnate night:--till the minutest rayWas quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart.It paused--it fluttered. But when heaven remainedUtterly black, the murky shades involved An image silent, cold, and motionless,As their own voiceless earth and vacant air.Even as a vapor fed with golden beamsThat ministered on sunlight, ere the westEclipses it, was now that wondrous frame--No sense, no motion, no divinity--A fragile lute, on whose harmonious stringsThe breath of heaven did wander--a bright streamOnce fed with many-voicèd waves--a dreamOf youth, which night and time have quenched forever-- Still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now.Oh, for Medea's wondrous alchemy,Which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleamWith bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhaleFrom vernal blooms fresh fragrance! Oh, that God,Profuse of poisons, would concede the chaliceWhich but one living man has drained, who now,Vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feelsNo proud exemption in the blighting curseHe bears, over the world wanders forever, Lone as incarnate death! Oh, that the dreamOf dark magician in his visioned cave,Raking the cinders of a crucibleFor life and power, even when his feeble handShakes in its last decay, were the true lawOf this so lovely world! But thou art fled,Like some frail exhalation, which the dawnRobes in its golden beams,--ah! thou hast fled!The brave, the gentle and the beautiful,The child of grace and genius. Heartless things Are done and said i' the world, and many wormsAnd beasts and men live on, and mighty EarthFrom sea and mountain, city and wilderness,In vesper low or joyous orison,Lifts still its solemn voice:--but thou art fled--Thou canst no longer know or love the shapesOf this phantasmal scene, who have to theeBeen purest ministers, who are, alas!Now thou art not! Upon those pallid lipsSo sweet even in their silence, on those eyes That image sleep in death, upon that formYet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tearBe shed--not even in thought. Nor, when those huesAre gone, and those divinest lineaments,Worn by the senseless wind, shall live aloneIn the frail pauses of this simple strain,Let not high verse, mourning the memoryOf that which is no more, or painting's woeOr sculpture, speak in feeble imageryTheir own cold powers. Art and eloquence, And all the shows o' the world, are frail and vainTo weep a loss that turns their lights to shade.It is a woe ""too deep for tears,"" when allIs reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit,Whose light adorned the world around it, leavesThose who remain behind, not sobs or groans,The passionate tumult of a clinging hope;But pale despair and cold tranquillity,Nature's vast frame, the web of human things,Birth and the grave, that are not as they were.

Autumn: A Dirge,"                        The warm sun is falling, the bleak wind is wailing,The bare boughs are sighing, the pale flowers are dying,                         And the YearOn the earth is her death-bed, in a shroud of leaves dead,                         Is lying.               Come, Months, come away,               From November to May,               In your saddest array;               Follow the bier               Of the dead cold Year,And like dim shadows watch by her sepulchre.The chill rain is falling, the nipped worm is crawling,The rivers are swelling, the thunder is knelling                         For the Year;The blithe swallows are flown, and the lizards each gone                         To his dwelling.               Come, Months, come away;               Put on white, black and gray;               Let your light sisters play--               Ye, follow the bier               Of the dead cold Year,And make her grave green with tear on tear.

Bereavement,"                        How stern are the woes of the desolate mourner     As he bends in still grief o'er the hallowed bier,As enanguished he turns from the laugh of the scorner,     And drops to perfection's remembrance a tear;When floods of despair down his pale cheeks are streaming,When no blissful hope on his bosom is beaming,Or, if lulled for a while, soon he starts from his dreaming,     And finds torn the soft ties to affection so dear.Ah, when shall day dawn on the night of the grave,     Or summer succeed to the winter of death?Rest awhle, hapless victim!  and Heaven will save     The spirit that hath faded away with the breath.Eternity points, in its amaranth bowerWhere no clouds of fate o'er the sweet prospect lour,Unspeakable pleasure, of goodness the dower,     When woe fades away like the mist of the heath.

A Dialogue,"                        DEATH:For my dagger is bathed in the blood of the brave,I come, care-worn tenant of life, from the grave,Where Innocence sleeps 'neath the peace-giving sod,And the good cease to tremble at Tyranny's nod;I offer a calm habitation to thee,--Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?My mansion is damp, cold silence is there,But it lulls in oblivion the fiends of despair;Not a groan of regret, not a sigh, not a breath,Dares dispute with grim Silence the empire of Death.I offer a calm habitation to thee,--Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?MORTAL:Mine eyelids are heavy; my soul seeks repose,It longs in thy cells to embosom its woes,It longs in thy cells to deposit its load, Where no longer the scorpions of Perfidy goad,--Where the phantoms of Prejudice vanish away,And Bigotry's bloodhounds lose scent of their prey.Yet tell me, dark Death, when thine empire is o'er,What awaits on Futurity's mist-covered shore? DEATH:Cease, cease, wayward Mortal! I dare not unveilThe shadows that float o'er Eternity's vale;Nought waits for the good but a spirit of Love,That will hail their blest advent to regions above.For Love, Mortal, gleams through the gloom of my sway, And the shades which surround me fly fast at its ray.Hast thou loved?--Then depart from these regions of hate,And in slumber with me blunt the arrows of fate.I offer a calm habitation to thee.--Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me? MORTAL:Oh! sweet is thy slumber! oh! sweet is the rayWhich after thy night introduces the day;How concealed, how persuasive, self-interest’s breath,Though it floats to mine ear from the bosom of Death!I hoped that I quite was forgotten by all,Yet a lingering friend might be grieved at my fall,And duty forbids, though I languish to die,When departure might heave Virtue’s breast with a sigh.O Death! O my friend! snatch this form to thy shrine,And I fear, dear destroyer, I shall not repine.                                             "
To A Skylark,"                        Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!              Bird thou never wert,        That from Heaven, or near it,              Pourest thy full heartIn profuse strains of unpremeditated art.        Higher still and higher              From the earth thou springest        Like a cloud of fire;              The blue deep thou wingest,And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.        In the golden lightning              Of the sunken sun        O'er which clouds are bright'ning,              Thou dost float and run,Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.        The pale purple even              Melts around thy flight;        Like a star of Heaven              In the broad daylightThou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight:        Keen as are the arrows              Of that silver sphere,        Whose intense lamp narrows              In the white dawn clearUntil we hardly see--we feel that it is there.        All the earth and air              With thy voice is loud.        As, when night is bare,              From one lonely cloudThe moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed.        What thou art we know not;              What is most like thee?        From rainbow clouds there flow not              Drops so bright to seeAs from thy presence showers a rain of melody.        Like a poet hidden              In the light of thought,        Singing hymns unbidden,              Till the world is wroughtTo sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:        Like a high-born maiden              In a palace tower,        Soothing her love-laden              Soul in secret hourWith music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:        Like a glow-worm golden              In a dell of dew,        Scattering unbeholden              Its aerial hueAmong the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:        Like a rose embowered              In its own green leaves,        By warm winds deflowered,              Till the scent it givesMakes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves.        Sound of vernal showers              On the twinkling grass,        Rain-awakened flowers,              All that ever wasJoyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.        Teach us, sprite or bird,              What sweet thoughts are thine:        I have never heard              Praise of love or wineThat panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.        Chorus hymeneal              Or triumphal chaunt        Matched with thine, would be all              But an empty vaunt--A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.        What objects are the fountains              Of thy happy strain?        What fields, or waves, or mountains?              What shapes of sky or plain?What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?        With thy clear keen joyance              Languor cannot be:        Shadow of annoyance              Never came near thee:Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.        Waking or asleep,              Thou of death must deem        Things more true and deep              Than we mortals dream,Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?        We look before and after,              And pine for what is not:        Our sincerest laughter              With some pain is fraught;Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.        Yet if we could scorn              Hate, and pride, and fear;        If we were things born              Not to shed a tear,I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.        Better than all measures              Of delightful sound,        Better than all treasures              That in books are found,Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!        Teach me half the gladness              That thy brain must know,        Such harmonious madness              From my lips would flowThe world should listen then, as I am listening now!

When The Lamp Is Shattered,"                        When the lamp is shattered,The light in the dust lies dead;    When the cloud is scattered,The rainbow's glory is shed;    When the lute is broken,Sweet tones are remembered not;    When the lips have spoken,Loved accents are soon forgot.    As music and splendorSurvive not the lamp and the lute,    The heart's echoes renderNo song when the spirit is mute:--    No song but sad dirges,Like the wind through a ruined cell,    Or the mournful surgesThat ring the dead seaman's knell.    When hearts have once mingled,Love first leaves the well-built nest;    The weak one is singledTo endure what it once possessed.    O Love! who bewailestThe frailty of all things here,    Why choose you the frailestFor your cradle, your home, and your bier?    Its passions will rock thee,As the storms rock the ravens on high;    Bright reason will mock thee,Like the sun from a wintry sky.    From thy nest every rafterWill rot, and thine eagle home    Leave thee naked to laughter,When leaves fall and cold winds come.                                             "

The Cloud,"                        I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,    From the seas and the streams;I bear light shade for the leaves when laid    In their noonday dreams.From my wings are shaken the dews that waken    The sweet buds every one,When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,    As she dances about the sun.I wield the flail of the lashing hail,    And whiten the green plains under,And then again I dissolve it in rain,    And laugh as I pass in thunder.I sift the snow on the mountains below,    And their great pines groan aghast;And all the night 'tis my pillow white,    While I sleep in the arms of the blast.Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,    Lightning, my pilot, sits;In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,    It struggles and howls at fits;Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,    This pilot is guiding me,Lured by the love of the genii that move    In the depths of the purple sea;Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,    Over the lakes and the plains,Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,    The Spirit he loves remains;And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,    Whilst he is dissolving in rains.The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,    And his burning plumes outspread,Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,    When the morning star shines dead;As on the jag of a mountain crag,    Which an earthquake rocks and swings,An eagle alit one moment may sit    In the light of its golden wings.And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,    Its ardors of rest and of love,And the crimson pall of eve may fall    From the depth of Heaven above,With wings folded I rest, on mine aery nest,    As still as a brooding dove.That orbed maiden with white fire laden,    Whom mortals call the Moon,Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,    By the midnight breezes strewn;And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,    Which only the angels hear,May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,    The stars peep behind her and peer;And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,    Like a swarm of golden bees,When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,    Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas,Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,    Are each paved with the moon and these.I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,    And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl;The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim    When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,    Over a torrent sea,Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,--    The mountains its columns be.The triumphal arch through which I march    With hurricane, fire, and snow,When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,    Is the million-colored bow;The sphere-fire above its soft colors wove,    While the moist Earth was laughing below.I am the daughter of Earth and Water,    And the nursling of the Sky;I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;    I change, but I cannot die.For after the rain when with never a stain    The pavilion of Heaven is bare,And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams    Build up the blue dome of air,I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,    And out of the caverns of rain,Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,    I arise and unbuild it again.

Quench within their burning bedThy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keepLike his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep;For he is gone, where all things wise and fairDescend; -oh, dream not that the amorous DeepWill yet restore him to the vital air;Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair.Most musical of mourners, weep again!Lament anew, Urania! -He died,Who was the Sire of an immortal strain,Blind, old, and lonely, when his country's pride,The priest, the slave, and the liberticideTrampled and mocked with many a loathed riteOf lust and blood; he went, unterrified,Into the gulf of death; but his clear SpriteYet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of light.Most musical of mourners, weep anew!Not all to that bright station dared to climb;And happier they their happiness who knew,Whose tapers yet burn through that night of timeIn which suns perished; others more sublime,Struck by the envious wrath of man or god,Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime;And some yet live, treading the thorny roadWhich leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene abode.But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has perished - The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew,Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew;Most musical of mourners, weep anew!Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last,The bloom, whose petals nipped before they blewDied on the promise of the fruit, is waste;The broken lily lies -the storm is overpast.To that high Capital, where kingly DeathKeeps his pale court in beauty and decay,He came; and bought, with price of purest breath,A grave among the eternal. -Come away!Haste, while the vault of blue Italian dayIs yet his fitting charnel-roof! while stillHe lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay;Awake him not! surely he takes his fillOf deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill.He will awake no more, oh, never more! - Within the twilight chamber spreads apaceThe shadow of white Death, and at the doorInvisible Corruption waits to traceHis extreme way to her dim dwelling-place;The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and aweSoothe her pale rage, nor dares she to defaceSo fair a prey, till darkness, and the lawOf change, shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw.O, weep for Adonais! -The quick Dreams,The passion-winged Ministers of thought,Who were his flocks, whom near the living streamsOf his young spirit he fed, and whom he taughtThe love which was its music, wander not, - Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain,But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their lotRound the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain,They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home again.And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head,And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries,""Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead;See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes,Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there liesA tear some Dream has loosened from his brain.""Lost Angel of a ruined Paradise!She knew not 'twas her own; as with no stainShe faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain.One from a lucid urn of starry dewWashed his light limbs as if embalming them;Another clipped her profuse locks, and threwThe wreath upon him, like an anadem,Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem;Another in her wilful grief would breakHer bow and winged reeds, as if to stemA greater loss with one which was more weak;And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek.Another Splendour on his mouth alit,That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breathWhich gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit,And pass into the panting heart beneathWith lightning and with music: the damp deathQuenched its caress upon his icy lips;And, as a dying meteor stains a wreathOf moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips,It flushed through his pale limbs, and passed to its eclipse.And others came... Desires and Adorations,Winged Persuasions and veiled Destinies,Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering IncarnationsOf hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs,And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleamOf her own dying smile instead of eyes,Came in slow pomp; -the moving pomp might seemLike pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream.All he had loved, and moulded into thought,From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound,Lamented Adonais. Morning soughtHer eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound,Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground,Dimmed the aereal eyes that kindle day;Afar the melancholy thunder moaned,Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay,And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay.Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains,And feeds her grief with his remembered lay,And will no more reply to winds or fountains,Or amorous birds perched on the young green spray,Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing day;Since she can mimic not his lips, more dearThan those for whose disdain she pined awayInto a shadow of all sounds: -a drearMurmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen hear.Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw downHer kindling buds, as if she Autumn were,Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown,For whom should she have waked the sullen year?To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dearNor to himself Narcissus, as to bothThou, Adonais: wan they stand and sereAmid the faint companions of their youth,With dew all turned to tears; odour, to sighing ruth.Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingaleMourns not her mate with such melodious pain;Not so the eagle, who like thee could scaleHeaven, and could nourish in the sun's domainHer mighty youth with morning, doth complain,Soaring and screaming round her empty nest,As Albion wails for thee: the curse of CainLight on his head who pierced thy innocent breast,And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest!Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone,But grief returns with the revolving year;The airs and streams renew their joyous tone;The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Season's bier;The amorous birds now pair in every brake,And build their mossy homes in field and brere;And the green lizard, and the golden snake,Like unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake.Through wood and stream and field and hill and OceanA quickening life from the Earth's heart has burstAs it has ever done, with change and motion,From the great morning of the world when firstGod dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed,The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delightThe beauty and the joy of their renewed might.The leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;Like incarnations of the stars, when splendourIs changed to fragrance, they illumine deathAnd mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;Nought we know, dies.

Woe is me!Whence are we, and why are we? of what sceneThe actors or spectators? Great and meanMeet massed in death, who lends what life must borrow.As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow.He will awake no more, oh, never more!""Wake thou,"" cried Misery, ""childless Mother, riseOut of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core,A wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs.""And all the Dreams that watched Urania's eyes,And all the Echoes whom their sister's songHad held in holy silence, cried: ""Arise!""Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung,From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung.She rose like an autumnal Night, that springsOur of the East, and follows wild and drearThe golden Day, which, on eternal wings,Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fearSo struck, so roused, so rapt Urania;So saddened round her like an atmosphereOf stormy mist; so swept her on her wayEven to the mournful place where Adonais lay.Our of her secret Paradise she sped,Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,And human hearts, which to her aery treadYielding not, wounded the invisiblePalms of her tender feet where'er they fell:And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they,Rent the soft Form they never could repel,Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May,Paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way.In the death-chamber for a moment Death,Shamed by the presence of that living Might,Blushed to annihilation, and the breathRevisited those lips, and Life's pale lightFlashed through those limbs, so late her dear delight.""Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless,As silent lightning leaves the starless night!Leave me not!"" cried Urania: her distressRoused Death: Death rose and smiled, and met her vain caress.""'Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again;Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live;And in my heartless breast and burning brainThat word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive,With food of saddest memory kept alive,Now thou art dead, as if it were a partOf thee, my Adonais!

On the withering flowerThe killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheekThe life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break.His head was bound with pansies overblown,And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue;And a light spear topped with a cypress cone,Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grewYet dripping with the forest's noonday dew,Vibrated, as the ever-beating heartShook the weak hand that grasped it; of that crewHe came the last, neglected and apart;A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter's dart.All stood aloof, and at his partial moanSmiled through their tears; well knew that gentle bandWho in another's fate now wept his own,As in the accents of an unknown landHe sung new sorrow; sad Urania scannedThe Stranger's mien, and murmured: ""Who art thou?""He answered not, but with a sudden handMade bare his branded and ensanguined brow,Which was like Cain's or Christ's -oh! that it should be so!What softer voice is hushed over the dead?Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown?What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed,In mockery of monumental stone,The heavy heart heaving without a moan?If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise,Taught, soothed, loved, honoured the departed one,Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs,The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice.Our Adonais has drunk poison -oh!What deaf and viperous murderer could crownLife's early cup with such a draught of woe?The nameless worm would now itself disown:It felt, yet could escape, the magic toneWhose prelude held all envy, hate, and wrong,But what was howling in one breast alone,Silent with expectation of the song,Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung.Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me,Thou noteless blot on a remembered name!But be thyself, and know thyself to be!And ever at thy season be thou freeTo spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow:Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee;Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt -as now.Nor let us weep that our delight is fledFar from these carrion kites that scream below;He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead;Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now - Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flowBack to the burning fountain whence it came,A portion of the Eternal, which must glowThrough time and change, unquenchably the same,Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame.Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep - He hath awakened from the dream of life - 'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keepWith phantoms an unprofitable strife,And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knifeInvulnerable nothings. -We decayLike corpses in a charnel; fear and griefConvulse us and consume us day by day,And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.He has outsoared the shadow of our night;Envy and calumny and hate and pain,And that unrest which men miscall delight,Can touch him not and torture not again;From the contagion of the world's slow stainHe is secure, and now can never mournA heart grown cold, a head grown grey in vain;Nor, when the spirit's self has ceased to burn,With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.He lives, he wakes -'tis Death is dead, not he;Mourn not for Adonais. -Thou young Dawn,Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from theeThe spirit thou lamentest is not gone;Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou AirWhich like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrownO'er the abandoned Earth, now leave it bareEven to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!He is made one with Nature: there is heardHis voice in all her music, from the moanOf thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird;He is a presence to be felt and knownIn darkness and in light, from herb and stone,Spreading itself where'er that Power may moveWhich has withdrawn his being to its own;Which wields the world with never-wearied love,Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above.He is a portion of the lovelinessWhich once he made more lovely: he doth bearHis part, while the one Spirit's plastic stressSweeps through the dull dense world, compelling thereAll new successions to the forms they wear;Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flightTo its own likeness, as each mass may bear;And bursting in its beauty and its mightFrom trees and beasts and men into the Heavens' light.The splendours of the firmament of timeMay be eclipsed, but are extinguished not;Like stars to their appointed height they climb,And death is a low mist which cannot blotThe brightness it may veil. When lofty thoughtLifts a young heart above its mortal lair,And love and life contend in it, for whatShall be its earthly doom, the dead live thereAnd move like winds of light on dark and stormy air.The inheritors of unfulfilled renownRose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought,Far in the Unapparent. ChattertonRose pale, -his solemn agony had notYet faded from him; Sidney, as he foughtAnd as he fell and as he lived and lovedSublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,Arose; and Lucan, by his death approved:Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.And many more, whose names on Earth are dark,But whose transmitted effluence cannot dieSo long as fire outlives the parent spark,Rose, robed in dazzling immortality.""Thou art become as one of us,"" they cry,""It was for thee yon kingless sphere has longSwung blind in unascended majesty,Silent alone amid an Heaven of Song.Assume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our throng!""Who mourns for Adonais?

From the world's bitter windSeek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.What Adonais is, why fear we to become?The One remains, the many change and pass;Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,Stains the white radiance of Eternity,Until Death tramples it to fragments. -Die,If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!Follow where all is fled! -Rome's azure sky,Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weakThe glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart?Thy hopes are gone before: from all things hereThey have departed; thou shouldst now depart!A light is passed from the revolving year,And man, and woman; and what still is dearAttracts to crush, repels to make thee wither.The soft sky smiles, -the low wind whispers near:'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither,No more let Life divide what Death can join together.That Light whose smile kindles the Universe,That Beauty in which all things work and move,That Benediction which the eclipsing CurseOf birth can quench not, that sustaining LoveWhich through the web of being blindly woveBy man and beast and earth and air and sea,Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors ofThe fire for which all thirst, now beams on me,Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.The breath whose might I have invoked in songDescends on me; my spirit's bark is drivenFar from the shore, far from the trembling throngWhose sails were never to the tempest given;The massy earth and sphered skies are riven!I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,The soul of Adonais, like a star,Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.

Ode To The West Wind,"                        IO wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves deadAre driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,Who chariotest to their dark wintry bedThe winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,Each like a corpse within its grave, untilThine azure sister of the Spring shall blowHer clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)With living hues and odors plain and hill:Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh, hear!IIThou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion,Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,Angels of rain and lightning: there are spreadOn the blue surface of thine aery surge,Like the bright hair uplifted from the headOf some fierce Maenad, even from the dim vergeOf the horizon to the zenith's height,The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirgeOf the dying year, to which this closing nightWill be the dome of a vast sepulchre,Vaulted with all thy congregated mightOf vapors, from whose solid atmosphereBlack rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh, hear!IIIThou who didst waken from his summer dreamsThe blue Mediterranean, where he lay,Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,And saw in sleep old palaces and towersQuivering within the wave's intenser day,All overgrown with azure moss and flowersSo sweet, the sense faints picturing them! ThouFor whose path the Atlantic's level powersCleave themselves into chasms, while far belowThe sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wearThe sapless foliage of the ocean, knowThy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,And tremble and despoil themselves: oh, hear!IVIf I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;A wave to pant beneath thy power, and shareThe impulse of thy strength, only less freeThan thou, O uncontrollable! If evenI were as in my boyhood, and could beThe comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speedScarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have strivenAs thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowedOne too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.VMake me thy lyre, even as the forest is:What if my leaves are falling like its own!The tumult of thy mighty harmoniesWill take from both a deep, autumnal tone,Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!Drive my dead thoughts over the universeLike withered leaves to quicken a new birth!And, by the incantation of this verse,Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearthAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!Be through my lips to unawakened earthThe trumpet of a prophecy!
